# illacceptanything

> The project where [literally](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/the-wrong-definition-of-literally-is-literally-going-in-the#.chA7QxZ9n)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

 * No porn.
 * Nothing illegal.
 * Can't violate GitHub terms of service.
 * Don't be a dick, or any other copulatory organ.
