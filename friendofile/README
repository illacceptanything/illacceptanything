friendofile: simple-golang-file-upload
======================================

A stupidly simple file upload service written in Go.

I've tried my best, but seriously - only let trusted users use this.
Put it behind an auth gate.

(Has a browse page - see screenshot.png!)

Have a look in index.html and main.go for all the things you'll need to set up.

Basically this listens on 127.0.0.1:8076/files/ and expects to have nginx
sitting in front of it. Nginx is responsible for serving Bootstrap and the 
like from /bootstrap/.
 
It also wants a bunch of Bootstrap stuff and some jQuery and a jquery
file upload control.

I've stuffed what I think is necessary in bootstrap.zip.

Due to use of syscall.Statfs, this expects to be running on a Unix-like.

Licenses: Check the headers of all the Bootstrap stuff!
I'm shipping someone's theme here.
The license of the golang code is under MIT/public domain - your preference.
