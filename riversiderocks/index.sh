echo We're no strangers to love
echo You know the rules and so do I
echo A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
echo You wouldn't get this from any other guy
echo I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
echo Gotta make you understand
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
echo Never gonna make you cry
echo Never gonna say goodbye
echo Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
echo We've known each other for so long
echo Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
echo Inside we both know what's been going on
echo We know the game and we're gonna play it
echo And if you ask me how I'm feeling
echo Don't tell me you're too blind to see
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
echo Never gonna make you cry
echo Never gonna say goodbye
echo Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
echo Never gonna make you cry
echo Never gonna say goodbye
echo Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
echo Never gonna give, never gonna give
echo (Give you up)
echo (Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give
echo (Give you up)
echo We've known each other for so long
echo Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
echo Inside we both know what's been going on
echo We know the game and we're gonna play it
echo I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
echo Gotta make you understand
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
echo Never gonna make you cry
echo Never gonna say goodbye
echo Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
echo Never gonna make you cry
echo Never gonna say goodbye
echo Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
echo Never gonna give you up
echo Never gonna let you down
echo Never gonna run around and desert you
