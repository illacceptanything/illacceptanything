Did he wake you, in the twilight?
Did he wake you, in the twilight?
In the twilight, did he wake you?
Did he wake you in the twilight?

Did he wake you, in the twilight,
In the twilight, did he wake you?
As embraced you slept together
under virgin sheets of cotten,
did he wonder, wonder whether
wonder if you had forgotten
of a week ago tonight?
In the twilight, did he wake you,
Did he wake you in the twilight?

Did he wake you in the twilight?
In the twilight did he wake you?
As a glowing fire roiled
from a source of fallen candle
striking rags and curtains oiled
to recieve the spark at midnight.
Did he wake you in the twilight,
in the twilight did he wake you?

Did he wake you in the twilight,
in the twilight did he wake you?
As the ravenous inferno,
sending sparks upon the pillow
grabbing hold of lamp and bedpost,
from a source of fallen candle.
Did he wake you as he saw it?
As he saw it, did he wake you?

In the twilight did he wake you,
did he wake you in the twilight?
As the stalwart flaming soldiers,
marched on over sheet and bedpost
forming beacheads in the bedroom,
Shooting smoke beneath his eyelid.
Did he wake you in the twilight?
In the twilight, did he wake you?

Did he wake you, in the twilight?
In the twilight, did he wake you?
As his panicked footfalls stumbled,
out of bed and out of chamber
down the stairs as fire rumbled
from a cradle of rags oiled
consuming the remainder
of the house and home you knew?
Now he staggers down the staircase,
leaving you to ask the question:
In the twilight, did he wake you?
Did he wake you in the twilight?

Did he wake you, in the twilight,
in the twilight did he wake you?
As a distant siren sounded,
and the neighbors gathered closer,
while the fireman's axe pounded
down the door of home you knew.
And the whispers of the neighbors
ask themselves a simple quesion:
Did he wake you in the twilight?
In the twilight did he wake you?

Did he wake you in the twilight,
in the twilight did he wake you?
Judges pacing through the ashes
finding rags and curtains oiled,
buried under cracks and crashes
of the house and home you knew?
And they ask a simple question:
Did he wake you in the twilight,
In the twilight did he wake you?

Did he wake you in the twilight,
in the twilight did he wake you,
As the magistrate descended,
looking on him with suspicion
as the robed judge recommended
to condemn him to perdition
for the ravenous inferno
which spread from his fallen candle.
For the judge has ceaced to wonder
if he woke you in the twilight. 

Will you wake him in his twilight?
In his twilight, will you wake him?
When he hangs beneath the scaffold
broken neck by rope suspended,
staring out upon the morning
with a ghost's transparent grin.
Will you wake him in his twilight,
in his twilight will you wake him?

If you wake him in his twilight,
in his twilight if you wake him?
Will he curse your face forever,
will you try your best to grasp him?
will you walk the lands forever?
Most important, will you ask him?
Did he wake you in the twilight?
In the twilight, did he wake you?
