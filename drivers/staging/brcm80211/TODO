To Do List for Broadcom Mac80211 driver

Features to be added
=====================
- 40 MHz channels
- Power Save
- AP
- IBSS
- HW-based encryption
- LED support
- RFKILL
- Debugfs and debugability

Code cleanup
============
- Use proper kernel coding standards
- Remove overlap with system header files. (ie much of include/proto/*.h should
  be removed)
- Purge unused variables/data structs/functions BUT keep code related to
  features that are being added (ie AP mode, 40 Mhz channels, IBSS etc).
- Replace proprietary utility functions with public kernel versions.

Bugs
====
- Various occasional asserts/hangs
- Scanning during data transfer sometimes causes major slowdowns.  Sometimes
  revcovers when scan is done, other times not.
- Mac80211 API not completely implemented (ie ops_bss_info_changed,
  ops_get_stats, etc)

Other
=====
- wlc_mac80211.[ch], wl_mac80211.[ch] and linux_osl.c all need to be refactored
    and combined.
- Merge files that are partially duplicated between the softmac and fullmac
  drivers
- Replace driver's proprietary ssb interface with generic kernel ssb module
  (only used when compiling for SDIO).
- PCI and SDIO support are currently #ifdef'ed exclusive of each other, which
  leads to a separate wl.ko for each.  This should be changed to runtime
  handling of different interfaces so that a single binary driver can be built.
- Add support for new chips (obviously an ongoing item).
