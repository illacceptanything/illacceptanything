config USB_ENESTORAGE
	tristate "USB ENE card reader support"
	depends on USB && SCSI && m
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you wish to control a ENE Card reader.

	  This option depends on 'SCSI' support being enabled, but you
	  probably also need 'SCSI device support: SCSI disk support'
	  (BLK_DEV_SD) for most USB storage devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called keucr.
