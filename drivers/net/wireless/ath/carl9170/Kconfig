	  This is another driver for the Atheros "otus" 802.11n USB devices.

	  This driver provides more features than the original,
	  but it needs a special firmware (carl9170-1.fw) to do that.

	  The firmware can be downloaded from our wiki here:
	  <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/carl9170>

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called carl9170.
