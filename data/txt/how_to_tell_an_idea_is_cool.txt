What makes for a good idea?

- You want to improve the world, not just putting your own name out there.
- If you copy someone else, you are copying in good faith and adding something of value.
- You are trying to work with other people, not against them. In particular, you usually avoid reinventing the wheel. Instead you build on other people's work and stand on their shoulders.
- The idea is very creative but once you think of it, it's pretty obvious.
- The idea is something that people really need.
- The idea is pretty reasonable to implement. It is a stepping stone from someting that already exists.
- Usually, your ideas are better if they are ideas about things that you actually have a clue. E.g., if you had an idea about llama farming but you are an auto mechanic, it might be a good idea, but how would you know that it was a good idea?
