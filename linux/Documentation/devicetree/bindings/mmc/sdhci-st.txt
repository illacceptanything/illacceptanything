* STMicroelectronics sdhci-st MMC/SD controller

This file documents the differences between the core properties in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt and the properties
used by the sdhci-st driver.

Required properties:
- compatible :  Must be "st,sdhci"
- clock-names : Should be "mmc"
                See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt
- clocks :      Phandle of the clock used by the sdhci controler
                See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- non-removable: non-removable slot
                 See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt
- bus-width: Number of data lines
                 See: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt

Example:

mmc0: sdhci@fe81e000 {
	compatible	= "st,sdhci";
	status		= "disabled";
	reg		= <0xfe81e000 0x1000>;
	interrupts	= <GIC_SPI 127 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupt-names	= "mmcirq";
	pinctrl-names	= "default";
	pinctrl-0	= <&pinctrl_mmc0>;
	clock-names	= "mmc";
	clocks		= <&clk_s_a1_ls 1>;
	bus-width       = <8>
};
