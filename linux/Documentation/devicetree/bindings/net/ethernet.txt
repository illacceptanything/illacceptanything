The following properties are common to the Ethernet controllers:

- local-mac-address: array of 6 bytes, specifies the MAC address that was
  assigned to the network device;
- mac-address: array of 6 bytes, specifies the MAC address that was last used by
  the boot program; should be used in cases where the MAC address assigned to
  the device by the boot program is different from the "local-mac-address"
  property;
- max-speed: number, specifies maximum speed in Mbit/s supported by the device;
- max-frame-size: number, maximum transfer unit (IEEE defined MTU), rather than
  the maximum frame size (there's contradiction in ePAPR).
- phy-mode: string, operation mode of the PHY interface; supported values are
  "mii", "gmii", "sgmii", "qsgmii", "tbi", "rev-mii", "rmii", "rgmii", "rgmii-id",
  "rgmii-rxid", "rgmii-txid", "rtbi", "smii", "xgmii"; this is now a de-facto
  standard property;
- phy-connection-type: the same as "phy-mode" property but described in ePAPR;
- phy-handle: phandle, specifies a reference to a node representing a PHY
  device; this property is described in ePAPR and so preferred;
- phy: the same as "phy-handle" property, not recommended for new bindings.
- phy-device: the same as "phy-handle" property, not recommended for new
  bindings.

Child nodes of the Ethernet controller are typically the individual PHY devices
connected via the MDIO bus (sometimes the MDIO bus controller is separate).
They are described in the phy.txt file in this same directory.
