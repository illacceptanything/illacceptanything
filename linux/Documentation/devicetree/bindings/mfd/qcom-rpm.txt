Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM)

This driver is used to interface with the Resource Power Manager (RPM) found in
various Qualcomm platforms. The RPM allows each component in the system to vote
for state of the system resources, such as clocks, regulators and bus
frequencies.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,rpm-apq8064"
		    "qcom,rpm-msm8660"
		    "qcom,rpm-msm8960"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size of the RPM's message ram

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: three entries specifying the RPM's:
		    1. acknowledgement interrupt
		    2. error interrupt
		    3. wakeup interrupt

- interrupt-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string-array>
	Definition: must be the three strings "ack", "err" and "wakeup", in order

- #address-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1

- #size-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 0

- qcom,ipc:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>

	Definition: three entries specifying the outgoing ipc bit used for
		    signaling the RPM:
		    - phandle to a syscon node representing the apcs registers
		    - u32 representing offset to the register within the syscon
		    - u32 representing the ipc bit within the register


= EXAMPLE

	#include <dt-bindings/mfd/qcom-rpm.h>

	rpm@108000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpm-msm8960";
		reg = <0x108000 0x1000>;
		qcom,ipc = <&apcs 0x8 2>;

		interrupts = <0 19 0>, <0 21 0>, <0 22 0>;
		interrupt-names = "ack", "err", "wakeup";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
