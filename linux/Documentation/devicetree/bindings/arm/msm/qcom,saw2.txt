SPM AVS Wrapper 2 (SAW2)

The SAW2 is a wrapper around the Subsystem Power Manager (SPM) and the
Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) hardware. The SPM is a programmable
micro-controller that transitions a piece of hardware (like a processor or
subsystem) into and out of low power modes via a direct connection to
the PMIC. It can also be wired up to interact with other processors in the
system, notifying them when a low power state is entered or exited.

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: shall contain "qcom,saw2". A more specific value should be
		    one of:
			 "qcom,saw2-v1"
			 "qcom,saw2-v1.1"
			 "qcom,saw2-v2"
			 "qcom,saw2-v2.1"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: the first element specifies the base address and size of
		    the register region. An optional second element specifies
		    the base address and size of the alias register region.


Example:

	regulator@2099000 {
		compatible = "qcom,saw2";
		reg = <0x02099000 0x1000>, <0x02009000 0x1000>;
	};
