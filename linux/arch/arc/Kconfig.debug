config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial
	  port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config 16KSTACKS
	bool "Use 16Kb for kernel stacks instead of 8Kb"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use a  16Kb stacksize for the
	  kernel stack attached to each process/thread. The default is 8K.
	  This increases the resident kernel footprint and will cause less
	  threads to run on the system and also increase the pressure
	  on the VM subsystem for higher order allocations.
