.SH NAME
turbostat \- Report processor frequency and idle statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B turbostat
.RB [ Options ]
.RB [ "\--interval seconds" ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBturbostat \fP reports processor topology, frequency,
idle power-state statistics, temperature and power on X86 processors.
There are two ways to invoke turbostat.
The first method is to supply a
\fBcommand\fP, which is forked and statistics are printed
upon its completion.
The second method is to omit the command,
and turbostat displays statistics every 5 seconds.
The 5-second interval can be changed using the --interval option.

Some information is not available on older processors.
.SS Options
\fB--Counter MSR#\fP shows the delta of the specified 64-bit MSR counter.
.PP
\fB--counter MSR#\fP shows the delta of the specified 32-bit MSR counter.
.PP
\fB--Dump\fP displays the raw counter values.
.PP
\fB--debug\fP displays additional system configuration information.  Invoking this parameter
more than once may also enable internal turbostat debug information.
.PP
\fB--interval seconds\fP overrides the default 5-second measurement interval.
.PP
\fB--help\fP displays usage for the most common parameters.
.PP
\fB--Joules\fP displays energy in Joules, rather than dividing Joules by time to print power in Watts.
.PP
\fB--MSR MSR#\fP shows the specified 64-bit MSR value.
.PP
\fB--msr MSR#\fP shows the specified 32-bit MSR value.
.PP
\fB--Package\fP limits output to the system summary plus the 1st thread in each Package.
.PP
\fB--processor\fP limits output to the system summary plus the 1st thread in each processor of each package.  Ie. it skips hyper-threaded siblings.
.PP
\fB--Summary\fP limits output to a 1-line System Summary for each interval.
.PP
\fB--TCC temperature\fP sets the Thermal Control Circuit temperature for systems which do not export that value.  This is used for making sense of the Digital Thermal Sensor outputs, as they return degrees Celsius below the TCC activation temperature.
.PP
\fB--version\fP displays the version.
.PP
The \fBcommand\fP parameter forks \fBcommand\fP, and upon its exit,
displays the statistics gathered since it was forked.
.PP
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS

.SH EXAMPLE
Without any parameters, turbostat displays statistics ever 5 seconds.
(override interval with "-i sec" option, or specify a command
for turbostat to fork).

The first row of statistics is a summary for the entire system.
For residency % columns, the summary is a weighted average.
For Temperature columns, the summary is the column maximum.
For Watts columns, the summary is a system total.
Subsequent rows show per-CPU statistics.

The \fBmax efficiency\fP frequency, a.k.a. Low Frequency Mode, is the frequency
available at the minimum package voltage.  The \fBTSC frequency\fP is the base
frequency of the processor -- this should match the brand string
in /proc/cpuinfo.  This base frequency
should be sustainable on all CPUs indefinitely, given nominal power and cooling.
The remaining rows show what maximum turbo frequency is possible
depending on the number of idle cores.  Note that not all information is
available on all processors.
.SH FORK EXAMPLE
If turbostat is invoked with a command, it will fork that command
and output the statistics gathered when the command exits.
eg. Here a cycle soaker is run on 1 CPU (see %c0) for a few seconds
until ^C while the other CPUs are mostly idle:

Above the cycle soaker drives cpu5 up its 3.8 GHz turbo limit
while the other processors are generally in various states of idle.

Note that cpu1 and cpu5 are HT siblings within core1.
As cpu5 is very busy, it prevents its sibling, cpu1,
from entering a c-state deeper than c1.

Note that the Avg_MHz column reflects the total number of cycles executed
divided by the measurement interval.  If the %Busy column is 100%,
then the processor was running at that speed the entire interval.
The Avg_MHz multiplied by the %Busy results in the Bzy_MHz --
which is the average frequency while the processor was executing --
not including any non-busy idle time.

.SH NOTES

.B "turbostat "
must be run as root.
Alternatively, non-root users can be enabled to run turbostat this way:

# setcap cap_sys_rawio=ep ./turbostat

# chmod +r /dev/cpu/*/msr

.B "turbostat "
reads hardware counters, but doesn't write them.
So it will not interfere with the OS or other programs, including
multiple invocations of itself.

\fBturbostat \fP
may work poorly on Linux-2.6.20 through 2.6.29,
as \fBacpi-cpufreq \fPperiodically cleared the APERF and MPERF MSRs
in those kernels.

AVG_MHz = APERF_delta/measurement_interval.  This is the actual
number of elapsed cycles divided by the entire sample interval --
including idle time.  Note that this calculation is resilient
to systems lacking a non-stop TSC.

TSC_MHz = TSC_delta/measurement_interval.
On a system with an invariant TSC, this value will be constant
and will closely match the base frequency value shown
in the brand string in /proc/cpuinfo.  On a system where
the TSC stops in idle, TSC_MHz will drop
below the processor's base frequency.

%Busy = MPERF_delta/TSC_delta

Bzy_MHz = TSC_delta/APERF_delta/MPERF_delta/measurement_interval

Note that these calculations depend on TSC_delta, so they
are not reliable during intervals when TSC_MHz is not running at the base frequency.

Turbostat data collection is not atomic.
Extremely short measurement intervals (much less than 1 second),
or system activity that prevents turbostat from being able
to run on all CPUS to quickly collect data, will result in
inconsistent results.

The APERF, MPERF MSRs are defined to count non-halted cycles.
Although it is not guaranteed by the architecture, turbostat assumes
that they count at TSC rate, which is true on all processors tested to date.
