What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/disksize
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The disksize file is read-write and specifies the disk size
		which represents the limit on the *uncompressed* worth of data
		that can be stored in this disk.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/initstate
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The disksize file is read-only and shows the initialization
		state of the device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/reset
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The disksize file is write-only and allows resetting the
		device. The reset operation frees all the memory assocaited
		with this device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/num_reads
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The num_reads file is read-only and specifies the number of
		reads (failed or successful) done on this device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/num_writes
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The num_writes file is read-only and specifies the number of
		writes (failed or successful) done on this device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/invalid_io
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The invalid_io file is read-only and specifies the number of
		non-page-size-aligned I/O requests issued to this device.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/notify_free
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The notify_free file is read-only and specifies the number of
		swap slot free notifications received by this device. These
		notifications are send to a swap block device when a swap slot
		is freed. This statistic is applicable only when this disk is
		being used as a swap disk.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/discard
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The discard file is read-only and specifies the number of
		discard requests received by this device. These requests
		provide information to block device regarding blocks which are
		no longer used by filesystem.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/zero_pages
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The zero_pages file is read-only and specifies number of zero
		filled pages written to this disk. No memory is allocated for
		such pages.

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/orig_data_size
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The orig_data_size file is read-only and specifies uncompressed
		size of data stored in this disk. This excludes zero-filled
		pages (zero_pages) since no memory is allocated for them.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/compr_data_size
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The compr_data_size file is read-only and specifies compressed
		size of data stored in this disk. So, compression ratio can be
		calculated using orig_data_size and this statistic.
		Unit: bytes

What:		/sys/block/zram<id>/mem_used_total
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Nitin Gupta <ngupta@vflare.org>
Description:
		The mem_used_total file is read-only and specifies the amount
		of memory, including allocator fragmentation and metadata
		overhead, allocated for this disk. So, allocator space
		efficiency can be calculated using compr_data_size and this
		statistic.
		Unit: bytes
