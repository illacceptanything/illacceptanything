# `test/core`

`test/core` directory is a place where tests from node.js core go. They are
here to ensure that node-http-proxy works just fine with all kinds of
different situations, which are covered in core tests, but are not covered in
our tests.

All these tests require little modifications to make them test node-http-proxy,
but we try to keep them as vanilla as possible.
