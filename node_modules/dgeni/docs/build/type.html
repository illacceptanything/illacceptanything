</p>
<h2>Params</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>ServiceTypeOrName</strong> { function(),string } - If a string then this is the name of the service, otherwise it is assumed to be the
`ServiceType`.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ServiceType</strong> { function } - The constructor function that will be used by the injector to create the processor.  The function
must not be anonymous - it must have a name, e.g. `function MyType() { ... }` - since the name of
the service is taken from the name of the constructor function.
  </li>
</ul>
