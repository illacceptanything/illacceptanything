<h1>processor (processor.html)</h1>
<p>Add a new processor to the package. The processor can be defined by a processor definition object
or a factory function, which can be injected with services and will return the processor definition
object.  The following properties of a processor definition object have special meaning to Dgeni:

* `name : {string}`:  The name of the processor - if the processor is defined by a factory
function or a name is explicitly provided as the first parameter, then this is ignored
* `$process(docs : {string}) : {Array|Promise|undefined}`: The method that will be called to
process the documents. If it is async then it should return a Promise.
* `$runAfter : {string[]}`: Dgeni will ensure that this processor runs after those named here.
* `$runBefore : {string[]}`: Dgeni will ensure that this processor runs before those named here.
* `$validate: {Object}`: Dgeni will check that the properties of the processor, which match the
keys of this object, pass the validation rules provided as the values of this object. See
http://validatejs.org

<h2>Params</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>processorDefOrName</strong> { function(),object,string } - If this parameter is a string then it will be used as the processor's name, otherwise it is
assumed that it used as the `processorDef`
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>processorDef</strong> { function(),object } - The factory function or object that will be used by the injector to create the processor.
* If a function then it is a factory and it must not be anonymous - it must have a name, e.g.
  `function myProcessor(dep1, dep2) { ... }` - since the name of the processor is taken from the
  name of the factory function.
* If an object, then it is the actual processor and must have a `name` property.  In this case,
  you cannot inject services into this processor.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>
  { Package } - `this` package, to allow methods to be chained.
