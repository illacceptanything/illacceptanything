URL2
----

This module builds upon the existing URL module in NodeJS, but adds
`relative(source, target)` which returns the shortest relative path
between any two equally qualified URLâ€™s.  If the paths are not equally
qualified, it returns the target.

In addition, this package augments the URL object definition as returned
by `parse` and consumed by `format`.

-   `pathname` is broken down into
    -   `root`: whether the path is qualified from the root of the
        domain.
    -   `relative`: the relative path, from the root if `pathname` is
        qualified from the domain root.
        -   `directories`: an array of path components
        -   `file`: the name of the file, or null if the URL points to a
            directory, indicated by a final slash.

Additionally, `format` uses the `path` property if it exists, instead of
`pathname` and `search`.
