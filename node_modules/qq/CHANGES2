Next major release BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE
 - Removed ``join`` in lieu of the new ``join`` in Q.
   The method previously created an immediate rejection and
   let you observe any subsequent rejections in the
   composite.  The new ``join`` provided in Q rejects with
   the first failure, opportunistically and does nothing to
   assist you in observing other rejections.
