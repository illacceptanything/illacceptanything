## 1.12.0

 - Adds support for socket timeout on HTTP requests as `http.request({timeout:
   50})` @akiron

## 1.11.5

 - Allow HTTP requests to specified a false agent, per the underlying Node.js
   behavior. (@grahamjenson)
 - Use npm carat operator for dependencies. (@anton-rudeshko)
 - The Node.js response argument is no longer being forwarded to HTTP request
   handlers.

## 1.11.4

 - Fixes mock modification and access times.

## 1.11.3

 - Update dependency to Q 1.0.1.
 - Fix an invalid reference in HTTP apps.

## 1.11.2

 - Fix race condition in `copyTree`
 - Decode `pathInfo` in HTTP requests
 - Pass all options through HTTP requests to Node.jsâ€™s HTTP client.
 - Allow `listDirectories` override in HTTP file services. (@stuk)

## 1.11.1

 - Fix to `fs.reroot`, binding this properly (@Stuk)
 - `fs.reroot` no longer traverses into directory prefixes implicitly.
   We do not expect anyone was depending on this strange behavior,
   but do expect folks were not using `reroot` because of it.
 - Many missing methods added to RootFs (@3on)
 - HTTP request normalization has been greatly improved.
   Particularly, the ambiguity of `host` vs `hostname` is resolved.
   `host` stands for both the hostname and the port, but only includes the port
   if it differs from the default port for the protocol.
   HTTP requests will normalize any combination of `host`, `port`, and
   `hostname`.
   The cookie jar HTTP application adapter has been updated.
 - Support for URL authorization has been improved. If you use the `auth`
   portion of a URL, it will be implicitly normalized to the corresponding
   `Authorization` header, for basic HTTP auth.
   Note that the convention in Q-IO is to use lower-case for all input and
   output headers, since they are case-insensitive.
 - MockFS now handles file modes properly (@Stuk)
 - `fs.copyTree` fixed for duplicate file modes (@Stuk)
 - Fix for HTTP clients on Node.js 0.11, which changed how it interprets the
   `agent` option.
 - Fixed a bug, NodeWriter was missing a `node` property, referring back to the
   Node.js writable stream.

## 1.11.0

 - Adds `removeDirectory` and `statLink` to the Mock file system interface.

## 1.10.7-8

 - Fixes support for range content requests, such that Q-IO based web serves can
   host static audio and video content to the web. Further work needed for the
   more escoteric non-contiguous multi-range requests.
 - Allow `copyTree` to write over existing trees. (@nerfin)

## 1.10.6

 - Restores the "request.terms.host" property to report which host pattern was
   selected by a host negotiator.

## 1.10.5

 - Fixes support for host negotiation.

## 1.10.4

   app. (@francoisfrisch)

   a proper forEachable. (@OliverJAsh)
