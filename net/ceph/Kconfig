	  Choose Y or M here to include cephlib, which provides the
	  common functionality to both the Ceph filesystem and
	  to the rados block device (rbd).

	  More information at http://ceph.newdream.net/.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CEPH_LIB_PRETTYDEBUG
	bool "Include file:line in ceph debug output"
	depends on CEPH_LIB
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, debug output will include a filename and
	  line to aid debugging.  This increases kernel size and slows
	  execution slightly when debug call sites are enabled (e.g.,
	  via CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG).

	  If unsure, say N.
