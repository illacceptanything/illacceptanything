## React 101

Interest in React has been exploding recently, so it's a good time to explore some great recent tutorials and videos that cover getting started.

[Ryan Clark](https://github.com/rynclark) provides a [great overview of the basics of React](http://ryanclark.me/getting-started-with-react/) with the goal of building a really simple dropdown nav.

[Formidable Labs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs) and [Seattle JS](http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/) recently hosted a series of React, Flux, and Flow workshops, and the first part is available to watch online:

[AEFlash](https://github.com/aearly) writes up [some best practices and tips](http://aeflash.com/2015-02/react-tips-and-best-practices.html) to help you avoid potential pitfalls when developing with React.

Black Mutt Media [takes us through their usage of React](http://blackmuttmedia.com/blog/react-tmdb-api/) and Ruby to build an autocomplete field, and some of the pitfalls they encountered along the way.

Our own [Sebastian Markbåge](https://github.com/sebmarkbage) was on the [Web Platform Podcast](http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/31-building-with-reactjs) to have a chat about all aspects of React.

## Community Additions

[Formidable Labs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs) have been busy, as they've also[ just launched Radium](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium/), a React component that provides you with the ability to use inline styles instead of CSS. They're also [looking for some help](http://projects.formidablelabs.com/radium-bootstrap/) contributing to a Radium Bootstrap implementation.

[Reactiflux.com](http://reactiflux.com/) is a new Slack community based around (you guessed it!) React, and Flux.

[React Week](http://reactweek.com/) is a week-long learning workshop, happening next week, for React, Flux, and other related technologies, run by [Ryan Florence](https://github.com/ryanflorence).

[Babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) is a new package which provides Sublime with language definitions for ES6 JavaScript with React JSX syntax extensions.

[react-meteor](https://github.com/reactjs/react-meteor), a package that replaces the default templating system of the Meteor platform with React, recently received a big update.

## Rebuilding with React

[Rich Manalang](https://github.com/rmanalan) from Atlassian [explains why](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/02/rebuilding-hipchat-with-react/) they rebuilt their HipChat web client from scratch using React, and how they're already using it to rebuild their native desktop clients.

[Andrew Hillel](https://twitter.com/andyhillel) of the BBC gives [an excellent and thorough breakdown](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/47a96d23-ae04-444e-808f-678e6809765d) of the stack they used to rebuild their homepage, with React as an integral part of the front-end.

A team from New Zealand called [Atomic](https://atomic.io/) is [building web and mobile prototyping and design tools](http://thenextweb.com/creativity/2015/02/19/meet-atomic-missing-tool-interface-design-thats-entirely-browser/) entirely in-browser, and as co-founder [Darryl Gray](http://twitter.com/darrylgray) says, “React.js “totally changed” the fact that browser performance often wasn’t good enough for complex tools like this.”.

[Polarr](https://github.com/Polarrco) have rebuilt [their browser-based photo editor](http://polarrist.tumblr.com/post/111290422225/polarr-photo-editor-2-0-alpha-is-here) with React.
