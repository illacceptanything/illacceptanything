[JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) just announced support for React. This is an exciting news as it makes collaboration on snippets of code a lot easier. You can play around this **[base React JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/vjeux/kb3gN/)**, fork it and share it! A [fiddle without JSX](http://jsfiddle.net/vjeux/VkebS/) is also available.
