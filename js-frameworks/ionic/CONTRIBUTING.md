Please read the contributing guide on the ionic website: http://ionicframework.com/contribute/

Please do not manually create issues on GitHub.

### Creating an Issue

If you have a question on how something works, or its expected functionality, you might want to visit the [Ionic Forum](http://forum.ionicframework.com/) first.

If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/issues?state=open). You can search through existing issues to see if someone's reported one similar to yours.

If not, then [create a codepen.io](http://codepen.io/ionic/public-list) that demonstrates the problem (try to use as little code as possible: the more minimalist, the faster we can debug it). Also, please do not group multiple topics into one issue, but instead each should be its own issue.

Next, [create a new issue](http://ionicframework.com/submit-issue/) that briefly explains the problem, and provides a bit of background as to the circumstances that triggered it. Don't forget to include the link to that [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/ionic/public-list) you created!

### Issue Etiquette Guidelines

Poor  attitude, ranting, name-calling, bullying, being a jerk, complaining, or spamming are fruitless and unacceptable. Issues that violate the open source spirit of this community, or  any of the guidelines listed here, may result in your Issue being deleted or reposted to our Forum, a better place for debate and discussion. If you wish to contribute, either make your response respectful or do not bother to respond. You’ll find it’s pretty ineffective.

Simply put: be respectful and act like an adult. Critiques are better made on the Forum. If you can’t do that, this isn’t a community  for you.


### Pull Request Guidelines

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, do not bundle more than one "feature" or bug fix per PR. Doing so makes it very hard to accept it if one of the fixes has issues.

It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

### Style

Always use two spaces, no tabs. This goes for any HTML, CSS, or Javascript.

### License

By contributing your code to the driftyco/ionic GitHub Repository, you agree to license your contribution under the MIT license.
