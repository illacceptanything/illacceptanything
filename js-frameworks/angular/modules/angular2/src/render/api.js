 * - this makes the ElementBinders more compact
 *   (e.g. no need to distinguish interpolations from regular expressions from literals)
 * - allows to retrieve which properties should be accessed from the event
 *   by looking at the expression
 * - we need the parse at least for the `template` attribute to match
 *   directives in it
 * - render compiler is not on the critical path as
 *   its output will be stored in precompiled templates.
