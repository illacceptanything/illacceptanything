Mojito Dashboard Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial includes an introduction and ten modules. Each module
explains a topic and then shows you how to build a Mojito application 
that focuses on the discussed topic. The applications you create 
build on those you created in prior modules, so the final
application is simply an aggregate of everything you learned. Our goal is that 
by the end of the tutorial that you will have the skills and knowledge to use Mojito to
build your own applications.

We'll be working through the following in this tutorial:
