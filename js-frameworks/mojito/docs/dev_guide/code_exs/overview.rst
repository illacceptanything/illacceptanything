Overview of Code Examples
=========================

The code examples intend to provide solutions for common problems. Each example 
requires creating an application, but code modifications are minimized for 
simplification and to isolate the problem that the code example is solving. 
To optimize your learning experience, the required time and 
skill level are given at the beginning of each example.

Format of Code Examples
-----------------------

In general, the code examples have the following format:

**Time Estimate / Difficulty Level** - approximates the time required to finish 
the example and the difficulty level to help you choose examples.

**Summary** - description of the code example and the topics covered.

**Implementation Notes** - includes a screenshot of the running application and
an explanation of code snippets that are considered essential to the example.

**Setting Up This Example** - steps for creating and running the code example.

**Source Code** - the link to the source code on GitHub for the code example.


.. note:: The steps in **Setting Up This Example** assume that you are running the 
          examples on a local host. Thus, the links provided to the application URL will 
          look like the following: ``http://localhost:8666/{code_example}``. To view 
          examples running on a remote server, point your browser to the appropriate 
          application URL.
