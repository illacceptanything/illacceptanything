logging, testing, and then move onto more advanced topics such as 
composite/framework mojits, extending Mojito, and context configurations.

.. _mojito_doc_directory-code_exs:

Code Examples
=============

The code examples are in cookbook format. We took common and very specific problems
faced by developers and created simple applications that isolated and then solved
the problem. Each example has annotated code snippets to emphasize key points and
steps for you to recreate and run the examples.
