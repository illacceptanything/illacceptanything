# ComponentJS TodoMVC Example

## About ComponentJS

> ComponentJS is a stand-alone MPL-licensed Open Source library for
JavaScript, providing a powerful Component System for hierarchically
structuring the User-Interface (UI) dialogs of complex HTML5-based Rich
Clients (aka Single-Page-Apps) â€” under maximum applied Separation
of Concerns (SoC) architecture principle, through optional Model,
View and Controller component roles, with sophisticated hierarchical
Event, Service, Hook, Model, Socket and Property mechanisms, and fully
independent and agnostic of the particular UI widget toolkit.

## Hints about the ComponentJS TodoMVC Example

This ComponentJS TodoMVC Example tries to
closely follow the official [TodoMVC App Specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md)
as long as there are no conflicting ComponentJS best practices.
The known resolved conflicts were:

- **Component Reusability and CSS Usage**:
  TodoMVC `todo-common` provides a `base.css` which was not
  directly used within this ComponentJS TodoMVC Example. There
  are two reasons for this:

    - **Single vs. Multiple Files**:
      The `base.css` provides all styles of the TodoMVC application
      in one single file, while in ComponentJS-based applications
      the styles are local to the components which create the
      corresponding DOM elements. In ComponentJS TodoMVC Example
      we have three such components (`root`, `main` and `todo`)
      and hence the `base.css` was split into three parts accordingly, too.

    - **Unique Ids vs. Class Selectors**:
      The styling in `base.css` is mainly based on unique identifiers (`#foo`)
      instead of classes (`.foo`). This is a big "no-go" for UI
      approaches like ComponentJS where UI widgets (here the `todo`
      UI component) are fully reusable and are potentially rendered
      multiple times into the same DOM tree. For the particular
      TodoMVC use case this does not happen, but the ComponentJS
      TodoMVC Example should have been strictly the way things
      are done in ComponentJS applications. As a result, all CSS
      selectors of `base.css` were converted from unique identifiers to
      [BEM](http://bem.info/method/definitions/)-like classes.

- **Source File Grouping**:
  TodoMVC recommends to group all sources files according to
  technical classifications. ComponentJS-based applications usually
  use a domain-specific classification to group files, i.e., the UI is
  split into domain-specific components and each component is fully
  self-contained. This means that each component consists of its own
  JavaScript code, its own style, its own mask, etc. As the TodoMVC use
  case is a trivial one, in the ComponentJS TodoMVC example you see this
  through the common filename prefixes only. In a real-world ComponentJS
  application one would see this also through the directory tree.

- **URL Routing**:
  The TodoMVC application speciification just requires that an URL
  based routing exists. In order to avoid extra code, one could have
  implemented this by using FlatIron Director directly within the `todo`
  component and especially just use direct hyperlinks in the view mask.
  While sufficient and perhaps acceptable for a trivial use case like
  the TodoMVC, it is not for a larger application. There the URL routing
  should be done only by a component which has the whole UI as the scope
  (the `root` and `main` components but not the `todo` widget) and there
  should be no direct hyperlinks within a single component (as it is not
  allowd to control the URL of the whole apllication). We use Flatiron
  Director in the `main` component and perform a two-way binding into
  the `todo` component.

- **LocalStorage**:
  The TodoMVC application speciification just requires that the
  todo list is persistend in the the HTML5 `localStorage`. In
  order to avoid extra code, one could have implemented this by
  allowing ComponentJS to implicitly persist the Todo list items into
  `localStorage` from within the `todo` widget with the help of the
  `component.plugin.localstorage.js` plugin. While sufficient and
  perhaps acceptable for a trivial use case like the TodoMVC, it is not
  for a larger application. There the Todo items would come from an
  underlying service tier and its UI-independent Business Model (while
  the UI widget uses a so-called Presentation Model). We decided to
  already use this strict separation between Presentation and Business
  model for the trivial TodoMVC use case, even if it increases the total
  amount of required code, of course.
