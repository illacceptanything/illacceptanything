# AngularDart TodoMVC Example

	> AngularDart is heavily inspired by AngularJS and is supercharged for Dart.
	> Core Angular features such as directives, data binding, and dependency
	> injection, are all there, and they've taken advantage of Dart's features
	> like metadata, types, and classes to feel natural for Dart developers.
	> AngularDart is also the first version of Angular to be built on emerging
	> web standards like Shadow DOM.

## Running

Dart compiles to JavaScript and thus runs across modern browsers. Dart also can
run in its own virtual machine.

Both Dart files and JS compilation result are provided in this sample,
therefore it actually works in any browser.

To edit and debug the code, you can use Dart Editor. The editor ships with the
[SDK](http://dartlang.org) and [Dartium](http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/), a
dedicated version of Chromium with an embedded Dart VM.

## Compiling

```
dart2js src/main.dart -o dist/main.js
```

The dart2js compilator can be found in the SDK.

The currently provided JS is minified (dart2js [...] --minify).
