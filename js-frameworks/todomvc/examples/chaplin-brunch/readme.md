# Chaplin & Brunch TodoMVC Example

> Chaplin is an architecture for JavaScript applications using the Backbone.js library. Chaplin addresses Backboneâ€™s limitations by providing a lightweight and flexible structure that features well-proven design patterns and best practices.

In this case, Backbone is replaced with [Exoskeleton](http://exosjs.com),
faster and leaner Backbone without dependencies on jQuery and underscore.
