## Implementation

Ractive.js isn't an MVC framework in the traditional sense. There are no Model classes, just a plain old array of task objects, and there is only one view object. The app lives in a single file, with two tiny extra files to handle persistence and routing.

This is because Ractive is optimised for developer sanity (as well as performance!). It was initially developed to create interactive news apps at [theguardian.com](http://theguardian.com), which have to be built against punishing deadlines and moving goalposts. Because it embraces reactive programming principles, the developer has less to worry about. Ractive's API is totally straightforward - you can learn it in 5 minutes and master it in a few hours.

It has a number of innovative features: animations, easier event handling, declarative transitions, first-class SVG support, logical expressions in templates with sophisticated dependency tracking. For many developers, it hits the sweet spot between the flexibility of a library like Backbone and the power of a framework like Angular.
