# Ember.js & RequireJS TodoMVC Example

This example was removed, because the Ember.js dependency injection architecture
does not provide appropriate hooks for asynchronous module loading yet and thus

To see what a TodoMVC application using Ember.js and RequireJS would look like
in its current state, visit:
