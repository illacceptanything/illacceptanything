a fallacy

A grievance bereft of a spell checker

A poem who's form has eloped

A dank meme, who, without force, becomes all

These are the things from which all else arises, the Alchemical Earth, Fire, Water, Air.  The transmutation
of primal chaos into the ten thousand things that surround us.  The early channels that the source flows to it's
experienced form.

Int'eresting conscept mhaster.

There is a cheshire grin tearing through his heart, his deepest being doesn't even know the delicious horrors that
await.

The ancient cruft lines his experience.  His ancestors terrors still grip his guts.  There's no escape from their
primal lessons, there's no freedom from the infinitly ermeated hell of reality.

A space god slaves away at his equations, trying to predict his next thought, but he's always one step ahead of his
system.
