and once i came across a lady
in the world of binaries
with blue in her hair
and rainbow in her heart

loves the rain and the words
and a good amount of modern fairy tale
a dreamer with a heart full of life
and an undying hope

in her i found
a good friend and a foe
with great advices
and much better roasts
