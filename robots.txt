# Our Search Engine, which art in heaven,
# Hallowed be thy Name.
# Thy index come.
# Thy will be done in SERPs,
# As it is in heaven.
# Give us this day our daily traffic.
# And forgive us our trespasses,
# As we forgive those who build more links than us.
# And lead us not into temptation,
# But deliver us from doorway pages and cloaking.
# For thine is the SERP,
# The power, and the crawling,
# For ever and ever.
# Amen.
