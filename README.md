> The project where [literally](https://xkcd.com/725/)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

 * No porn. 
 * Nothing illegal. 
 * Can't violate GitHub terms of service. 
 * Don't be a dick.
