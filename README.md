# illacceptanything

> The project where [literally](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/the-wrong-definition-of-literally-is-literally-going-in-the#.chA7QxZ9n)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

 1. No porn. 
 1. Nothing illegal. 
 1. Can't violate GitHub terms of service. 
 1. Don't be a dick.
