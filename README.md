# illacceptanything

> The project where literally* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

We're no strangers to love. You know the rules, and so do I:

\* No porn. Nothing illegal. Can't violate GitHub terms of service. Don't be a dick.

\* A full commitment's what I'm thinkin' of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy.
