# Arduino IDE 1.8

> The project where literally* anything goes

This is the new home of the Arduino IDE.  Now written in Python and Node.js (io.js need not apply).

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.
