# illacceptanything

> The project where [literally](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/the-wrong-definition-of-literally-is-literally-going-in-the#.chA7QxZ9n)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't have the will-power to create my own. Therefore, I am looking to piggy-back off of contributors' hardwork to build the project. I really don't care what pull-request you make, I'll accept it.

Let's see what happens.
