> The project where literally* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

Project is now vectoring towards python. The king of all languages.

\* No porn. Nothing illegal. Can't violate GitHub terms of service. Don't be a dick.
