> The project where [literally](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/the-wrong-definition-of-literally-is-literally-going-in-the#.chA7QxZ9n)* anything goes

I want to make a really cool project, but I don't know what to make. So I'll just accept
every Pull Request submitted and see what happens.

 * No porn. 
 * Nothing illegal. 
 * Can't violate GitHub terms of service. 
 * Don't be a dick.

- You may or may not be living within a universe with some frogs.
- Your life is governed by frogs.
- The universe is managed by frogs and there is nothing you can do about it.
    - Apart from, of course, be a frog yourself. Then the universe will break down at the fact that a human has become a frog, then there will be no problem, since problems can only exist within an active universe.
- Frog.
- Frog. Frog. Frog!
- Frog.
