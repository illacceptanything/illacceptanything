**When you are old** - By WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS
>  *When you are old and grey and full of sleep,*<br/>
>  *And nodding by the fire, take down this book,*<br/>
>  *And slowly read, and dream of the soft look*<br/>
>  *Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;*<br/>
>  *How many loved your moments of glad grace,*<br/>
>  *And loved your beauty with love false or true,*<br/>
>  *But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,*<br/>
>  *And loved the sorrows of your changing face;*<br/>
>  *And bending dow beside the glowing bars,*<br/>
>  *Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled*<br/>
>  *And paced upon the mountains overhead*<br/>
>  *And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.*<br/>
