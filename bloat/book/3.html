<h2>Hi Friends</h2>
<br>
So why learn Ruby? What's the reasoning? Why so many crusaders for something that runs off chunky bacon 
and belief in human happiness? Surely it must be absurd? But that is nigh. For here we come to a land where
the dark arts' secrets read like english, the rich and intelligent share with the poor and ignorant, and the
world leaves it's garage door unlocked so you can check out and use your neighbors tools, or maybe even build
them and yourself some better ones.

<h3>Ruby is from a different world.</h3>
<p>And it will help you control yours. It is free. It is powerful. It is pretty. It is also available readily to
play anytime.</p>
<p>No, no, no. This isn't cousin Tommy and his big, bench pressing guns. Its brothersisterlifepartner Ruby.<br></p>

<p>And its here to help you explore!</p>

<p>We have friends. Or, you may have used to. Or you never have. Who cares.</p>
<h4>POINT IS</h4>
<p>Folks got names.</p>

<p>In programming, there are usually said to be two hard things:</p>

<h4>Time zones.</h4>

<h4>Naming things.</h4>

<p>Well poo. Why are we starting with one of the hard ones?</p>

<p>Well, because like a good human-based (or bovine-based, or orca-based) language has a certain eloquence to it.</p>

<p>You don't stare listen to the French guy's story about eating a duck because you hate ducks, and seek to hear
a tale of a European man consuming one be regaled in great detail. You listen because, even if you don't understand</p>

<p><i>It sounds eloquent</i></p>

<p>You <i>get</i> it.</a>

<p>Our journey begins now with the IRB shell we just launched prior
</p>
<div style='text-align: left;'>

</div>
It seems we have printed something. And even named something.

We can even make a <i>function</i>, A core tool which will allow us to assign one operation to a name.

But first, let us talk about the importance of names

  <p>
If there is one thing Ruby has right, it is names. There are names for everything, so that you do not
have to deal with the eternal struggle of sitting for an hour and not being able to think of the perfect
name. Let's look at Ruby's use of naming.
  </p>
<code>
$ irb<br>

$ veggies = ['peanut butter', 'koala aggression', 'repressed memory', 'espresso']<br>

$ veggies.include? "onions" <br>

=> false <br>

$ def eat;end<br>

$ veggies.each { |vegetable| eat(vegetable) } <br>

$ veggies.count <br>

=> 4<br>

$ "america".capitalize # get it? <br>

=> "America"

</code>

<p>You might be thinking, "well gee willickers batman, I think I'm reading english!"

You are! And you can tell a machine what to do in English now that you've got Ruby</p>
<p>
Let's start by looking at Ruby's standard library methods for strings.
<p><code>
ascii_only?, capitalize, upcase, downcase, encode, encoding, end_with?,
include?, length, prepend, replace, reverse, size, slice, start_with?, 
swapcase, to_i</code>
</p>
<p>
Looking at this sample of all string methods, it is pretty darn clear what you can do to a string.
We can check encoding an encode, get length, substitute x for y, reverse it all, we can turn it to an
integer, we can capitalize names. We can prepend names with something. We can check if some text
is inside another string. There is a world of potential for us now that we have cracked open the door
of Ruby's standard library.</p>

<p>

Ruby has a great approach in that it tries to shoot for maximum <i>Developer Happiness</i>.
Personally, i think it does it better than anything else ever has yet. Though i wont say that
it never will. As we go further here, first we will take a whirlwind tour of the language, and
then we will proceed to dissect some things, and begin building from scratch.
