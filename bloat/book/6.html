    Let's talk strings. And these ones will be the least silly. In fact they behave exactly as one would inspect.
    In ruby, we have many ways to do things with strings. We can deepen our grokking of this later, for now, we
    must meditate upon the simple things.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let us start with a single quoted (<code>'there is a horse is aisle 5'</code>) strings.
    If we take the string we just had, paste it in the interpreter, and run <code>.methods.count</code>
    On it, we would get <code>164</code>, however if we change it to double quotes, we could get
    <code>164</code> as well. So it appears that we can use the same functions on both. That's nice,
    no need to learn weird rules. There are many ways to make strings and text in Ruby. We have everything
    from literals like <code>%q</code> and <code>%Q</code> for representing single and double quoted strings
    respectively, to heredocs. Let's start with a string we'll call name. We're going to greet whoever we set <code>name</code> to.
    </br>
    <code>
name = "Frank Gallagher"<br>
puts 'hi name'<br>
puts "hi #{name}"<br>
    </code>
    <br>
    <h3>See what we did there?</h3>
    <textarea placeholder='Type your code in here, and paste it into the evaluator'></textarea>
    <iframe  style='width:800; height:400;' width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src='../exec_rb/index.html'></iframe>.</center>
<p>
It is clear what the string does. You may play with it more. In fact, if you want to get a string from a user....
<br><code>
puts "What is your favorite type of muffler?"<br>

response = gets.chomp <br>

puts response<br>
</code><br>
<p>
And now we can vary input...manipulate strings. If you can't tell, this is step one in telling the computer what
the fuck it ought to do.
