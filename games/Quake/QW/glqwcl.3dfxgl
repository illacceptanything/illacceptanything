# This script preloads the lib3dfxgl.so library which overrides the functions
# present in libMesaGL.so.  This allows glquake to run using 3DFX's miniport
# and without Mesa 3-D.  Glide and X11 libraries have to be installed tho, 
# even tho GLQuake doesn't use X11, it's linked against it because Mesa 3-D
# requires them.
