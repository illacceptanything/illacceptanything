I. THE STORY
A. Background
      You get the phone call at 4 a.m. By 5:30 you're in the secret
   installation. The commander explains tersely, "It's about the Slipgate
   device. Once we perfect these, we'll be able to use them to transport
   people and cargo from one place to another instantly.

      "An enemy codenamed Quake, is using his own slipgates to insert death
   squads inside our bases to kill, steal, and kidnap..

      "The hell of it is we have no idea where he's from. Our top scientists
   think Quake's not from Earth, but another dimension. They say Quake's
   preparing to unleash his real army, whatever that is.

      "You're our best man. This is Operation Counterstrike and you're in
   charge. Find Quake, and stop him ... or it ... You have full authority
   to requisition anything you need. If the eggheads are right, all our
   lives are expendable.."

B. Prelude to Destruction
      While scouting the neighborhood, you hear shots back at the base Damn,
   that Quake bastard works fast! He heard about Operation Counterstrike,
   and hit first. Racing back, you see the place is overrun. You are almost
   certainly the only survivor. Operation Counterstrike is over. Except for
   you.

      You know that the heart of the installation holds a slipgate.
   Since Quake's killers came through, it is still set to his dimension.
   You can use it to get loose in his hometown. Maybe you can get to the
   asshole personally. You pump a round into your shotgun, and get moving.
      
II. INSTALLING QUAKE
A. Installation
   You must install Quake before you can play it. It will not run off the
   CD-ROM. Place the CD-ROM into your drive, log on to that drive, and type
   'INSTALL'. If you have downloaded Quake via modem, simply go to the
   directory you've placed Quake in, unzip it, and type 'INSTALL'.

B. README.TXT
   After you install Quake, you go right into the README.TXT file, which is
   henceforth available in your Quake directory. This is a full listing of
   Quake's technical parameters, and is constantly updated with new versions
   of Quake. We strongly recommend that after you install Quake, you glance
   through README.TXT.

   You may wish to print this file out, so you can have a copy of it on hand
   while playing Quake.

C. MANUAL.TXT
   Also available in your Quake directory is a file labeled MANUAL.TXT.
   This is the file you are now reading.

D. TECHINFO.TXT
   For those who are more technically inclined, or to fill out a bug report,
   check out TECHINFO.TXT. Information on filling out a bug report is located
   at the end of TECHINFO.TXT.


III. THE BASICS OF PLAY
A. Goal of the Game
	Quake has two basic goals. First, stay alive. Second, get out of the
        place you're in. The first level of each episode ends in a slipgate -- 
        these signify thatyou're entering another dimension. When you complete 
        an entiredimension (this takes six to eight levels), you'll find a
        Rune and another slipgate, which returns you to the start. 

B. Skill
	The start area has three short hallways. The one you go down selects
        the Skill you wish to play at.
	Easy -- This is meant for little kids and grandmas. 
	Medium --  Most people should start Quake at Medium skill. 
	Hard -- Here at id, we play Hard skill, and we think you should too,
        once you're ready.
	(Nightmare) -- This is so bad that the entry is hidden, so people
        won't wander in by accident. If you find it, don't say we didn't warn
        you.

C. Episode
	After the Skill halls, you're in a room with four exits. Each exit
        leads to a different military complex, at the end of which is a
        slipgate leading to a new dimension. If you have not registered, the 
        first episode, Dimension of the Doomed, is the only place you can go. 
        After registration, all four episodes are available. The other three 
        episodes, in order from second to fourth, are Realm of Black Magic, 
        Netherworld, and The Elder World.

=============================================================================
== TIP -- From episode 1 to episode 4, the dimensions become progressively ==
== more difficult. We suggest you play the episodes in the proper order to ==
== get the maximum fun out of Quake.                                       ==
=============================================================================

D. Getting About
      The specific keys named below can be changed by using the Configure Keys
      Menu. If you have renamed Run as the R key, for instance, then the Shift 
      key will not double your speed. 
   Walk
      Use the arrow keys or the mouse. To walk steadily forward, hold down
      the Forward key (up arrow or center mouse button). Turn left or right
      with the left or right arrow keys or sliding your mouse to the left or 
      right.
   Run
      Hold down Run (the Shift key) to double your speed.
   Jumping
      Tap the Jump key (the space bar or Enter key). You jump further if 
      you're moving forward, and you jump higher if you're moving up a slope at 
      the time. You'll be surprised at the spots you can reach in a jump. You 
      can even avoid some attacks by jumping at the right time.
   Swimming
      When underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go, and
      move forward. You have full three-dimensional freedom. Unfortunately,
      as in real life, you may lose your bearings while underwater. Use
      jump (the space bar or Enter key) to kick straight up towards the
      surface. Once on the surface, tread water by holding down jump.
      To get out of the drink, swim towards the shore. Once there, use jump
      to clamber up. If you're down a well or you can't get a grip, you may
      not be able to climb out. There is always another way out, but you may
      have to submerge to find it.
   Shooting
      Tap the Shoot key (the Ctrl key or left mousebutton) to fire. Hold it 
      down tokeep firing.
   Use
      Quake has no "Use" function. To push a button or open a door, walk up
      to it. To ride a platform up or down, step atop it. If a door won't open 
      or a platform won't lower, you may need to do something special to 
      activate it.
   Picking up stuff
      To pick up items, weapons, and power-ups, walk over them. If you can't
      pick up something, it means you already have the maximum possible of 
      that thing. If it is armor, it means the stuff you're trying to get is 
      worse than what you now have.

E. Finding Things
   Buttons and Floorplates
      Buttons activate with a touch, and floorplates must be stepped on.
      If you see a distinctive-looking button in a spot you cannot reach,
      it's probably a shootable button-- fire at it.
   Doors
      Most doors open at your approach. If one doesn't, seek a button,
      floorplate, or key.
   Secret Doors
      Some doors are camouflaged. Almost all secret doors open when they are
      shot or hit with an axe. The rest are opened by hidden pressure plates
      or buttons.
   Platforms
      Most platforms only go up and down, while some follow tracks around
      rooms or levels. When you step atop of a platform, it rises to its
      full height, and usually only lowers when you step off. Some platforms
      must be activated via button or pressure plate.
   Pressure Plates & Motion Detectors
      Invisible or visible sensors which open doors, unleash traps, warn
      monsters, etc.
   Uncovering Secrets
      Secrets are hidden lots of ways. You might need to shoot a button, kill
      a monster, walk through a secret motion detector, etc.
   The Secret of Secrets
      All secrets in Quake are indicated by clues. Don't waste your time
      hacking at every wall. It's much more productive (and fun) to use your
      brain and your eyes. Look up. An angled texture, a light shining under
      a wall, a strange sound -- anything -- might be the clue. Something
      prominent in a room might be decoration ... or it might be the clue.

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Bouncing a grenade off a shootable button or secret door won't   ==
== open it, but if the grenade's explosion goes off nearby, this may       ==
== activate such secrets.                                                  ==
=============================================================================

   Main Menu, tap the Escape key again. To exit the menu and return to the
   game, tap the Escape key when you are on the Main Menu.

   NEW GAME
      Discards the game you're playing, and starts anew.

   MULTIPLAYER
      Controls multiplayer game starting and details...
      Name
         Type your name or alias here, and all messages about you will use
         this. So the computer says stuff like, "Josephine rides Bad Bill's
         rocket."
      Shirt Color
         Lets you select your character's uniform color from 14 different
         options (numbered 0-13).
      Pants Color
         As above, but your pants color also determines what team you're on,
         if in team play. (After all, pants are more important than shirts.)
      Communications Configuration
         Takes you to a separate menu on which you can change communications
         settings.
         Com Port
            Selects the COM Port to use for Communications. A null modem or 
            modem must be connected to this port.
         Baud Rate
            Selects the COM port baud rate (9600-57600bps). This is NOT the
            same as setting the modem speed. The COM port speed must be AT 
            LEAST the same speed as the modem speed.
         Device
            Selects the type of connection, either direct (null-modem) or
            modem.
         Modem Init String
            The Initialization string for the modem. 
      
      Start a Multiplayer Game
         If you want your machine to be the host for a multiplayer game 
         (Note: if you are starting a listen server, id Software strongly 
         recommends that the fastest machine act as the host! If you are
         playing a game with more than 4 players, we suggest using a 
         dedicated server as the host!), select this option, and you'll get
         the following menu  ...
         Begin Game
            Starts up the game. Now all your friends have to do is log on, 
            using either "search for local network games" or "join a 
            running game at..." Multiplayer options (see below). 
         Maximum Players
            You can have up to 16 players. You need at least 2, or it's not 
            "multiplayer", right?
         Game Type
            Toggles between cooperative and deathmatch.
         Team Color Rules
            Toggles between "none" and "no friendly fire". In the latter mode, 
            your shots won't injure someone wearing the exact same color 
            pants as you. 
         Skill
            Chooses skill level. Only applicable in a cooperative game. 
         Frag Limit
            From none to 100, in ten-frag increments. When someone reaches 
            the frag limit, by killing the 40th (or whatever) person, then 
            the game ends immediately, and final scores are printed. If your 
            frag limit is none, the game won't end till someone exits the 
            level or the time limit expires. 
         Time Limit
            From none to 60 minutes, in 10 minute increments. When the time
            limit is up, the game ends immediately, and final scores are 
            printed. If your time limit is none, the game won't end till 
            someone exits the level or the frag limit is reached. 
         Start Map 
            Lets you choose what map you'd like to play on. The top line 
            gives you the episode name, and the lower line is the level's 
            name. Note that all levels in Quake are fun to play, but the 
            episode Deathmatch Arena is composed of special levels that are 
            solely-designed for deathmatch play. Try them, you'll like them. 
      Search For Local Network Games
         Has your computer look through your network. It will list all the 
         games it finds on the console, and you can choose to join one of 
         them by typing connect <server>.
      Join A Running Game At ... 
         Lets you join a game either by typing its net address (for a net 
         game) or your friend's modem phone number (for a modem game). 
         If necessary, ensure your modem and network connections are operative 
         by checking your Communications Configuration menu. 

   SAVE
      Brings up a list of saved games. Highlight the desired slot, and tap the      Enter key. Each saved game is identified by the level's name, plus the 
      proportion of kills you have achieved so far. 
   LOAD
      Brings up a list of saved games. Highlight the desired slot, and tap the
      Enter key. 
   OPTIONS
      Miscellaneous game options ...
         Configure Keys
            Permits you to customize Quake so every action is linked to the 
            button or key that you prefer. 
               First, move the cursor (via the arrow keys) to the action you 
            wish to change. Then tap the Enter key. Now press the key or 
            button you want to bind to that action. For instance, if you wish
            to use the Alt key for Jump, move the cursor to Jump / Swim, tap 
            the Enter key, then press the Alt key. 
               Each action can have two different keys assigned to it. If you 
            already have two keys in an entry, you cannot add more from this 
            menu. 
               To clear the keys bound to an action, move the cursor to that 
            action and tap the Backspace or Delete key instead of the Enter 
            key. This will clear the keys formerly bound to that action, 
            leaving it blank.
               You can bind any key to an action except Function keys, the 
            Escape key, and the ~ (tilde) key. "Weird" keys such as Scroll 
            Lock, Print Screen, etc. may or may not work, depending on your 
            machine, but why bother?
 
            Attack
               Fires your weapon
            Change Weapon
               Switches to the weapon "above" the one you're now using. Wraps 
               around to the axe.
            Jump / Swim Up
               If you're on land, jumps. If you're underwater, kicks you 
               towards the surface. If you're right at the water's edge, pops
               you up out of the water, if you combine it with forward 
               movement. 
            Walk Forward 
            Backpedal 
            Turn Left 
            Turn Right 
            Run
               Press this while moving, and you move at double speed. 
            Step Left
               Sidesteps (strafes) left
            Step Right
               Sidesteps (strafes) right
            Sidestep
               Press this when using turn left or turn right and you sidestep
              (strafe) instead.
            Look Up
               Lets you angle your view upwards. Your view returns to 
               horizontal when you start walking forward. 
             Look Down
               Lets you angle your view upwards. Your view returns to 
               horizontal when you start walking forward. 
             Center View
                If  you're looking up or down, returns your view to dead 
                center. 
             Mouse Look
                Press this to allow your mouse to look up or down (by 
                sliding it forward and back), and to remain looking up or 
                down even if you move forward. 
             Keyboard Look
                Press this to use your movement keys to look up or down. 
             Go To Console
                Brings down the Console. Also possible by tapping the 
                ~ (tilde) key. 
             Reset To Defaults
                Everything you've changed in the options menu is reset by 
                this option. Consider it an "Oops" key. 
             Screen Size
                A slider which enlarges or shrinks your view area. All 
                Quake's sliders use the right and left arrow keys. 
             Brightness
                Pretty much self-explanatory. Choose a brightness which 
                doesn't strain your eyes. 
             Mouse Speed
                Adjusts mouse sensitivity. The further you set the slider 
                to the right, the quicker your mouse reacts. 
             Music Volume
                Self-explanatory
             Sound Effects Volume
                Self-explanatory
             Always Run
                When this is selected, you do not need the Run key -- you 
                are always at double speed.
             Invert Mouse Up / Down
                This gives your mouse "airplane-style" controls. This means 
                that pushing the mouse forward "noses down", and pulling it 
                back "noses up". Some people prefer this control technique. 
              Lookspring
                 Returns your view immediately to straight ahead when you 
                 release the look up / down key. Otherwise, you must move 
                 forward for a step or two before your view snaps back. 
                 Lookspring does not work while you are underwater. 
              Lookstrafe
                 If you are using the look up / down key, then this option 
                 causes you to sidestep instead of turn when you try to move 
                 left or right.

   HELP / ORDERING
      Lists the default keyboard and mouse commands. Also contains the 
      information you need to register Quake. 
    QUIT
      Exits Quake at once. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Quake saves your current key configuration when you quit, so     ==
== next time you play, you have the same configuration.                    ==
=============================================================================

C. Console
      Tap the ~ (tilde) key to bring down the console. As with the Main Menu, 
   when the console is down, a singleplayer game is paused. A wide variety of
   esoteric commands can be entered at the console. If your keyboard has no 
   ~ (tilde), the Options Menu (inside the Main Menu) has a "Console" option. 

D. Command Line
   For special command line parameters, see README.TXT. 

E. Cheat Codes
   id Software, as in our previous games, has removed all cheat codes from 
   Quake. 

V. THE GAME
A. The Screen
      The large top part of the screen is the view area, in which you see 
   monsters and architecture. Immediately below is the Inventory, beneath 
   which is the Status Bar. You can enlarge the viewing area (tap the + key), 
   so much that it engulfs first the Inventory Bar and then the Status Bar. 
   The - key shrinks the view area. 

   Inventory Bar
      Lists ammo, weapons, deathmatch scores, and power-ups.
         The active weapon is lit up. Each weapon has a number by it -- type 
      the appropriate number key to switch to that weapon.
         In addition, this gives the amount of ammo you have of each type, 
      any keys you possess, and any power=ups currently active. Plus it shows 
      how many and which of the four Runes you possess. 
         In Deathmatch, it shows the top four scores in the game. 

   Status Bar
      A vital part of the screen. When your armor, hit points, or ammo get 
      low, the number turns red. 
         From left to right, the big numbers represent: Armor Points, Health, 
      and Ammo (of the current weapon). Icons show the Armor Type (green,  
      yellow, or red), your adorable face, and your Ammo Type). 

   Score Bar
      Hold down theTab key to replace the Status Bar with the Score Bar. 
         This lists the proportion of monsters you've killed, secrets you've 
      found, and time you've spent, along with the level name. 
         In Deathmatch, the Score bar lists the top six scorers, along with 
      their names. 

B.  Messages 
   Quake talks to you from time to time. Some messages appear at the top of 
   the screen. These are non-critical, and tell you that you've picked up an 
   object, or you've died in an interesting fashion. Ignore these messages if
   you please. 
      Certain messages appear inconveniently in the middle of your view. These 
   are always important, and you do not want to ignore them!

D Ending a Level
   Once you finish a level, you'll find a slipgate or a distinctive archway 
   leading to the next level. Pass through to emerge onto a new level. 
      You start the new level with the same armor, weapons, and ammo you had at 
   the end of the previous one. If a power-up was active at the end of the 
   previous level, it is now, sadly, gone. Make the best of it. If your hit 
   points were over 100 or under 50, they are altered to 100 or 50, 
   respectively. Otherwise, your hit points are unchanged. 

D. Ending a Dimension
   Once you've finished all the levels in a particular dimension, you return 
   to the starting hall. New dimensions are started from scratch -- you, your 
   shotgun, and axe.

VI. Your New Environment
A. Firepower
   You are blessed with eight different Means o' Mass Destruction. Each has 
   its place in a balanced diet. 

   Axe
      The last resort. Face it  -- going toe-to-toe with the uglies in Quake
      demonstrates all the good sense of a man parachuting into an alligator 
      farm. 

   Shotgun
      The basic gun, to which all other guns compare favorably.

   Double-barrelled Shotgun
      A worthy weapon with three minor drawbacks: first, it uses up 2 shells 
      per blast; second, it's slow; third, its shot pattern is very loose at 
      long range. But in general, once you find this puppy, the other shotgun 
      starts rusting from disuse. 

   Nailgun
      A two-barrel dingus that prickles bad guys with armor-piercing darts, 
      technically termed "nails". 

   Supernailgun 
      The great equalizer. Four cyclic barrels that hose out spikes like 
      crazy. Pro: foes drop like flies. Con: eats ammo like popcorn. 

   Grenade Launcher
      Thumps neat exploding bombs into the air. You can even bounce a grenade
      off the wall or floor.. When a grenade hits someone, it explodes. 
      If it misses, the bomb sits on the floor for a moment, then explodes. 
      Even though I sometimes bounce grenades into myself, this gun's still 
      my favorite. 

   Rocket Launcher
      For when a grenade positively, absolutely, has to be there on time. 

   Thunderbolt  
      Try it. You'll like it. Use the same technique as watering your 
      rosebush.

   Switching Between Weapons
      If you are firing a weapon and run out of ammo, Quake automatically 
      switches you to another weapon. It will never switch to the grenade 
      launcher or rocket launcher, however, for reasons that ought to be 
      obvious. So if you're firing away happily and suddenly switch to the 
      axe, it doesn't mean you're out of all ammo -- you may still have 
      grenades. But Quake requires you to select such dangerous 
      explosives on your own. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- If you shoot the Thunderbolt underwater, it discharges all its ==  
== cells in every direction in a single gigantic KA-ZAP, with you at the   == 
== center. Don't try this at home.                                         ==
=============================================================================

B. Ammo
   The eight weapons use four types of ammo. Each ammo type comes in two 
   flavors -- small and large. The large boxes carry twice as much as the 
   small. 

   Shells 
      For shotguns and double-barrelled shotguns. A small box holds 20.

   Flechettes 
      For nailguns and supernailgunss. A small box holds 25. 

   Grenades 
      For grenade launchers and rocket launchers. A small crate holds 5.

   Cells 
      For Mr. Thunderbolt. A small battery has 6 charges, lasting a little 
      over a second.

C. Power-ups
   All power-ups except armor burn out after a while, so smoke 'em while you 
   got 'em. 

   Armor 
      Comes in three flavors; green, yellow, and red, from weakest to most 
      powerful.

   Megahealth
      Gives you 100 additional hit points. After a few seconds, all hit points 
      over 100 start slowing draining away, because it's too much for the human 
      frame to hold. Still, it's nice while it lasts. 

   Biosuit 
      lets you breathe underwater and swim through slime without harm. Does 
      not protect against lava. 

   Ring of Shadows 
      Renders you almost totally invisible. Only your eyes can be seen. 
      Monsters don't detect you unless you do something stupid. Like shoot.

   Pentagram of Protection 
      Renders you invulnerable. 

   Quad Damage 
      Magnum upgrade! You now deliver four times the pain!

=============================================================================
== TIP -- When quad damage is activated, use the grenade or rocket         ==
== launcher with care -- their bursts are four times as deadly to you, as  ==
== well as your enemies.                                                   ==
=============================================================================

D. Bad Guys
   Quake critters are extremely tough, but you have the firepower to vent 
   your grievances on them anyway. Good hunting. 

   Rottweiler
      Bad, bad doggie! Play dead! -- blam! -- yipe! Good  dog!

   Grunt 
      Goons with probes inserted into their pleasure centers; wired up so 
      when they kill someone, they get paroxysms of ecstasy. In essence, 
      customized serial killers. Easy to kill, and they tote shotgun shells. 
      It's like a little Christmas each time you blow a Grunt away!

   Enforcer (registered only) 
      Grunt, Mark Two. Recruits who are surlier and beefier than the rest get 
      outfitted in combat armor and built-in blasters. 

   Knight 
      Canned meat. Open 'er up and see if it's still fresh. 

   Death Knight (registered only) 
      This particular canned meat tends to open you up instead. 

   Rotfish (registered only) 
      Disgusting little critters who dish it out, but can't take it.

   Zombie
      Thou canst not kill that which doth not live. But you can blast it 
      into chunky kibbles. 

   Scrag 
      Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee. Ugly as hell. They're not 
      real tough, but like to bushwhack you. 

   Ogre 
      What's worse than a cannibal monster eight feet tall? One with a 
      chainsaw. And a sack of grenades.

   Spawn (registered) 
      A merrily bouncing blob as dangerous to kill as to ignore. Blech.

   Fiend 
      In essence, organic buzzsaws, rife with pummeling power! 

   Vore (registered) 
      A spideresque hybrid horror. Keep your eye on the energy pod he hurls. 

   Shambler 
      Even other monsters fear him, so expect a clobbering. He shrugs off 
      explosions. Good luck. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Some weapons are better vs. particular monsters than others. If  ==
== a new monster seems real tough, switch weapons.                         ==
=============================================================================

E. Environmental Hazards and Effects

   Explosions
      Radioactive containers are in some military bases. Shooting these 
      things unleashes a big boom, so be careful -- you may not want to 
      stand too close in a firefight. 
         Your own grenades and rockets cause explosions too, of course -- the 
      blast can hurt you if you're too close. 

   Water 
      Safe enough unless you stay under so long you start to drown. Come up 
      for air periodically to prevent this. 

   Slime 
      Hurts you instantly and keeps on hurting. Stay out of slime unless you 
      have a very good reason to take a dip. 

   Lava 
      If you're quick and the lava's shallow, you might escape before you're 
      burnt to a crisp,  but don't bet on it. 

   Traps 
      Quake has many different traps. Don't be paranoid, because traps aren't 
      really very common, but be aware of their existence. Traps can't be 
      classified because they come in many varieties -- monsters in ambush, 
      spike shooters, crushing walls, trapdoors, etc. 

    Teleporters 
      These are distinctive in appearance and emit a unique sound. When you 
      step into a teleporter, you're instantly transported to another 
      teleporter, or atop a teleport pad. If you teleport directly right atop 
      of somebody else, he or she is killed instantly. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Monsters are smart enough not to activate their own traps, but   ==
== if you activate the traps, the monsters can get caught by them.         ==
=============================================================================

VII. Multiplayer Action 
   Quake can be even more fun when you're playing with friends than when 
   you're playing by yourself.
      When you are using the console or Main Menu in multiplayer, the game does
   not pause. Irresponsible players and monsters can freely shoot you, and
   your only recourse is bloodthirsty vengeance. 
     The Talk function is useful here. When you talk, the message appears at 
   the top of all players' screens, preceded by the speaker's name.
     To talk, press 'T' and start typing your message. Press ENTER to set
   the message to everyone.
     To set up, run, or join a multiplayer game, use the Main Menu Multiplayer
   option. README.TXT contains details that may be useful if your network or 
   modem need special configurations. 

A. Cooperative
   In a co-op game, you and your friends work together to finish the level. 
   When one person exits, everyone else exits too, wherever they might be. If 
   you are killed in co-op, you reappear at the start area, and have to catch 
   up to your buddies. Use Talk to find out where they are. See the 
   Multiplayer options on the Main Menu for more info.

B. Deathmatch	
   In a deathmatch, play is totally cutthroat. No monsters exist, and when 
   you are killed, you reappear in a random spot. After you pick up an item, 
   it respawns (i.e. pops back into existence) after a while. (Some items 
   take longer to respawn than others.) Every time you kill someone, you get 
   a Frag. The person with the most Frags wins, so wreak slaughter amongst 
   your pals! 
      If you kill yourself, whether intentionally or by accident, you lose a 
   Frag. This includes drowning, getting crushed, and so forth. See the 
   Multiplayer options on the Main Menu for more info.

C. Team Games 
   Team play is a cool combination of co-op and deathmatch. Each team picks 
   a "uniform" and everyone on that team changes their color to the team 
   color. The team with the most Frags wins. See README.TXT or the Main Menu 
   for details. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- if you have the Team Color Rules set to No Friendly Fire, your   ==
== weapons won't hurt other players wearing the same color pants as you.   ==
== (You can still have differently-colored shirts.) Your shots still wear  ==
== down their armor, and your own grenade and rocket explosions still hurt ==
== YOU, just not them.                                                     ==
=============================================================================

VIII. Commonly Asked Questions

Q. I'm stuck. How do I get through the level?
A. Take a stroll around and look for a place you haven't been yet. Sometimes 
you have to kill a particular monster in order to progress, so exterminate 
them all!

Q. How can I find all the secrets? 
A. Don't worry about it. You never have to find a secret to finish a level.. 
Also, some secrets are intentionally hard to find. 

Q. I've cleared out the whole level, but my monster kill score isn't 100%. 
Where are they hiding?
A. Some monsters hide inside secrets, or are released by them. You won't be 
able to kill those monsters until you find their secrets. Also, some monsters 
might  lurk underwater. Good fishing. 

Q. Don't you worry that Quake teaches people that all problems can be solved 
by the misuse of deadly force? 
A. No. 

Q. Did I really see two monsters fighting each other?
A. Probably. Some monsters hate one another almost as much as they hate you. 
You can use this to your advantage (exercise left up to the reader). 

Q. How do I prevent motion sickness when watching Quake?
A. If you're one of the unlucky sufferers from motion sickness in Quake, 
we're sorry to say the answer seems to differs from person to person. Try 
sitting closer to the screen, or further away. Dim the lights in your room, 
or turn them up high. Adjust screen brightness up or down. Take a break from 
Quake and rest your eyes every hour or so. One or more of these tricks, or a 
combination, ought to work. 

Q. Are you guys Satan-worshipers?
A. No.
