                   Quake III: Team Arena
                 Installation instructions
                          ------

What you need:                          

- retail CD-ROM of Quake III Arena for Windows or linux
- optionally, retail CD-ROM of Quake III: Team Arena 
- a computer running linux (kernel >= 2.2 glibc >= 2.1)
- running the client requires X11 and 3D hardware acceleration with OpenGL

Installation:

If you have the retail CD-ROM of Quake III Arena for linux:
- install Quake III Arena from the CD-ROM
- run the Point Release installer
(to buy Quake III Arena for linux online, try http://www.tuxgames.com/)

If you have the retail CD-ROM of Quake III Arena for Windows:
- run the Point Release installer first
- now you need to copy the main pak files from the CD-ROM
  or from your win32 partition. Namely, you need to copy baseq3/pak0.pk3
  and for Team Arena, missionpack/pak0.pk3
  see below for more instructions on how to copy the files:

WARNING: Those instructions are provided as a reference, 
depending on your distribution the CD-ROM might not have the same 
mount point. Please refer to your linux documentation for additional 
information.

- open a root shell and cd to the default installation path:
  cd /usr/local/games/quake3
- mount the Quake III Arena CD-ROM and install the game content
  cp /mnt/cdrom/Quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3 /usr/local/games/quake3/baseq3
- optionally, mount the Quake III: Team Arena CD-ROM
  cp /mnt/cdrom/Setup/missionpack/pak0.pk3 /usr/local/games/quake3/missionpack
  
NOTES:
- If you are running Quake III Arena and Quake III: Team Arena on a 
  Windows partition, you can save some space by symlinking the game 
  assets to their windows installation:
  ln -s /win/quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3 /usr/local/games/quake3/baseq3/pak0.pk3
  ln -s /win/quake3/missionpack/pak0.pk3 /usr/local/games/quake3/missionpack/pak0.pk3
  (Windows partition is mounted as /win and Quake III Arena installation is C:\quake3)
