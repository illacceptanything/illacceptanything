        is a multiplayer addon for Quake2 that features a simple
        set of rules for team based play. It features five unique
        maps and special powerups to enhance and make the
        gameplay more exciting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Q2CTF requires the full retail
        version of Quake II installed in order to play. Once
        installed, you simple need to connect to a Quake2 game
        server that is running the Q2CTF addon.</font><a

        <p><font face="Arial">Capture the Flag is a multiplayer
        addon for Quake2 that features a simple set of rules for
        team based play.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The basic rules are:</font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">When connecting to the server,
                you join one of two teams: the Red team and the
                Blue team</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">Each team has a base with a
                flag positioned in it.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">The object of the game is to
                infiltrate the enemy base, take their flag and
                bring it back to your base.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">In order to successfully
                complete a capture, you must be carrying the
                enemy flag and touch your flag while carrying it
                at your base.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial">When playing Q2CTF, there are
        several different indicators on your Heads Up Display
        (HUD) that show the status of the game. Learning to
        interpret the information on this display is important in
        learning how to play Q2CTF.</font></p>

        grapple lets you get to parts of the level that were
        previously inaccessible and can be used as a great tool
        to increase your mobility. It can also be used as a
        weapon, but it only does the same damage as the blaster,
        so it's not very effective.</font></p>

                you will be pulled to the spot the grapple
                connected. Once at your destination, let go of
                the fire button to release the grapple.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">You can also hang from the
                ceiling or wall with the grapple. You would go
                there by performing a normal grapple maneuver,
                but once you get to your destination, do not
                release the fire button. Instead, while holding
                down the fire button, change to a different
                weapon in midair. Once the change is completed,
                let go of the fire button and you'll be left
                hanging from the ceiling. When you want to drop
                off the ceiling, switch back to the grapple and
                make sure your fire button is not held down.
                You'll be released and will fall from your

        <h3><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial">Communicating With
        Your Team</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial">A very important part of any
        multiplayer team based game is communication. Letting
        your teammates know where you are and what you are doing
        is an essential part of teamwork.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Q2CTF has a basic team
        communication called &quot;say_team&quot; or
        &quot;messagemode2&quot;. It is like the regular
        communication of Quake2, but you need to bind a key in
        order to use it. I use the &lt;R&gt; key myself, since
        its right beside the normal &lt;T&gt; key used for
        communication. To bind it, use the following:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><code>bind r
        &quot;messagemode2&quot;</code></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">When you want to say a message to
        your team, just hit &lt;R&gt; and type it in. This image
        shows me telling what I'm doing to my team:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img
        src="say_team.gif" alt="(Zoid): At base, defending"
        width="462" height="32"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Note the parenthesis around my
        name. This indicates it is a team message and only people
        on your team saw it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Now, normally I don't type a lot of
        my team messages, I have several standard messages I use
        to communicate with my teammates. They are bound to
        several keys like so:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><code>bind z &quot;say_team Base
        secure&quot;<br>
        bind x &quot;say_team Base overrun! Recover&quot;<br>
        bind c &quot;say_team Incoming!&quot;<br>
        bind v &quot;say_team I'm going offensive&quot;<br>
        bind g &quot;say_team Going to base&quot;<br>
        bind b &quot;say_team At base, defending&quot;</code></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">So when I want to say &quot;At
        base, defending&quot; to my teammates, I just hit my
        &lt;B&gt; key to do so. This is much faster than typing
        it out all the time.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Q2CTF also features some advanced
        options for communicating to your teammates. This feature
        is called &quot;auto macros&quot;. It lets you configure
        generic messages that will automatically be filled in as
        necessary. Here's an example.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><code>bind f &quot;say_team I'm %L,
        %H and %A, and have %T.&quot;</code></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That looks kind of cryptic, but
        here's what happens when I hit the F key I bound that
        say_team to:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img
        src="automac.gif" width="590" height="62"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">What this means is each of the %
        macros in the say_team are automatically changed into
        something specific to the situation. In this case, the %L
        changes to a description of my current location, %H
        changes to how much health I have, %A changes to indicate
        how much armor I have and %T changes to indicate what
        TECH Powerup I'm carrying.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Here is a table of all the
        different % automacros and what they do.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">Q2CTF features a

        of matches between two teams. The competition mode (once
        it has been activated by an admin or by an election)
        works in three stages:</font></p>
        <ol>
            <li><font face="Arial">When competition mode is
                activated, the game enters the setup phase. This
                where the players pick their teams, discuss
                strategies and prepare for the match. Players can
                move around the level, but can't pick up any
                items or damage any enemy players. If the server
                isn't dedicated to match play, there is a timer
                in this phase that determines how long players
                have to set up their game. If they don't set it
                up in the needed period of time, the server will
                reset back to normal play. When the players have
                established their teams, each player must enter
                'ready' to commit to the game. Once everyone has
                committed, the game enters phase two. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">In this phase, everyone has
                committed and the game is about to begin. There
                is usually a twenty second countdown before the
                match actually starts. During this time, any
                player may enter 'notready' at the console to
                abort the countdown. After the countdown
                completes, phase three begins.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial">At the point the match is
                begin. Everyone is respawned (sometimes with a
                small two or three second delay to even out the
                spawns in the bases, if everyone respawned,
                telefrags and overflows could occur) in their
                base and the match begins. Players are also
                assigned their ghost codes which can be used to
                re-enter the game in case of a undesired
                disconnection.</font></li>

                        This controls the length of the match.
                        The default is a twenty minute match

                        match is in progress. For example, if a
                        match started that was twenty minutes
                        long and two minutes had already passed

                        and the admin changed the match length to
                        ten minutes, the remaining time would
                        automatically be changed to eight
                        minutes. If the admin sets a match time
                        less than the amount of time already
