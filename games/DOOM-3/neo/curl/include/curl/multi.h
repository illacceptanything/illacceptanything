  This is meant to be the "external" header file. Don't give away any
  internals here!

  This document presents a mixture of ideas from at least:
  - Daniel Stenberg
  - Steve Dekorte
  - Sterling Hughes
  - Ben Greear

  -------------------------------------------
  GOALS

  o Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses libcurl decides where
    and when to ask libcurl to get/send data.

  o Enable multiple simultaneous transfers in the same thread without making it
    complicated for the application.

  o Enable the application to select() on its own file descriptors and curl's
    file descriptors simultaneous easily.

 *          error code from the transfer or just the fact that a transfer is
 *          completed. More details on these should be written down as well.
 *
 *          Repeated calls to this function will return a new struct each
 *          time, until a special "end of msgs" struct is returned as a signal
 *          that there is no more to get at this point.
 *
 *          The data the returned pointer points to will not survive calling

 *
 *          The 'CURLMsg' struct is meant to be very simple and only contain
 *          very basic informations. If more involved information is wanted,
 *          we will provide the particular "transfer handle" in that struct
 *          and that should/could/would be used in subsequent
 *          curl_easy_getinfo() calls (or similar). The point being that we
 *          must never expose complex structs to applications, as then we'll
 *          undoubtably get backwards compatibility problems in the future.
 *
 * Returns: A pointer to a filled-in struct, or NULL if it failed or ran out
 *          of structs. It also writes the number of messages left in the
 *          queue (after this read) in the integer the second argument points
 *          to.
