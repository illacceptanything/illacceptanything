TODO

 Things to do in project cURL. Please tell us what you think, contribute and
 send us patches that improve things! Also check the http://curl.haxx.se/dev
 web section for various technical development notes.

 All bugs documented in the KNOWN_BUGS document are subject for fixing!

 LIBCURL

 * Introduce an interface to libcurl that allows applications to easier get to
   know what cookies that are received. Pushing interface that calls a
   callback on each received cookie? Querying interface that asks about
   existing cookies? We probably need both. Enable applications to modify
   existing cookies as well. http://curl.haxx.se/dev/COOKIES

 * Introduce another callback interface for upload/download that makes one
   less copy of data and thus a faster operation.
   [http://curl.haxx.se/dev/no_copy_callbacks.txt]

 * More data sharing. curl_share_* functions already exist and work, and they
   can be extended to share more. For example, enable sharing of the ares
   channel.

 * Introduce a new error code indicating authentication problems (for proxy
   CONNECT error 407 for example). This cannot be an error code, we must not
   return informational stuff as errors, consider a new info returned by
   curl_easy_getinfo() #845941

 * Option to set the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to make libcurl notice and
   disconnect very long time idle connections.

 LIBCURL - multi interface

 * Add curl_multi_timeout() to make libcurl's ares-functionality better.

 * Make sure we don't ever loop because of non-blocking sockets return
   EWOULDBLOCK or similar. This FTP command sending, the SSL connection etc.

 * Make transfers treated more carefully. We need a way to tell libcurl we
   have data to write, as the current system expects us to upload data each
   time the socket is writable and there is no way to say that we want to
   upload data soon just not right now, without that aborting the upload. The
   opposite situation should be possible as well, that we tell libcurl we're
   ready to accept read data. Today libcurl feeds the data as soon as it is
   available for reading, no matter what.

 DOCUMENTATION

 * More and better

 FTP

 * Support the most common FTP proxies, Philip Newton provided a list
   allegedly from ncftp:
   http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2003-04/0126.html

 * Make CURLOPT_FTPPORT support an additional port number on the IP/if/name,
   like "blabla:[port]" or possibly even "blabla:[portfirst]-[portsecond]".

 * FTP ASCII transfers do not follow RFC959. They don't convert the data
   accordingly.

 * Since USERPWD always override the user and password specified in URLs, we
   might need another way to specify user+password for anonymous ftp logins.

 HTTP

 * Digest and GSS-Negotiate support for HTTP proxies. They only work on
   direct-connections to the server.

 * Pipelining. Sending multiple requests before the previous one(s) are done.
   This could possibly be implemented using the multi interface to queue
   requests and the response data.

 TELNET

 * Reading input (to send to the remote server) on stdin is a crappy solution
   for library purposes. We need to invent a good way for the application to
   be able to provide the data to send.

 * Move the telnet support's network select() loop go away and merge the code
   into the main transfer loop. Until this is done, the multi interface won't
   work for telnet.

 SSL

 * If you really want to improve the SSL situation, you should probably have a
   look at SSL cafile loading as well - quick traces look to me like these are
   done on every request as well, when they should only be necessary once per
   ssl context (or once per handle). Even better would be to support the SSL
   CAdir option - instead of loading all of the root CA certs for every
   request, this option allows you to only read the CA chain that is actually
   required (into the cache)...

 * Add an interface to libcurl that enables "session IDs" to get
   exported/imported. Cris Bailiff said: "OpenSSL has functions which can
   serialise the current SSL state to a buffer of your choice, and
   recover/reset the state from such a buffer at a later date - this is used
   by mod_ssl for apache to implement and SSL session ID cache". This whole
   idea might become moot if we enable the 'data sharing' as mentioned in the
   LIBCURL label above.

 * OpenSSL supports a callback for customised verification of the peer
   certificate, but this doesn't seem to be exposed in the libcurl APIs. Could
   it be? There's so much that could be done if it were! (brought by Chris
   Clark)

 * Make curl's SSL layer option capable of using other free SSL libraries.
   Such as the Mozilla Security Services
   (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/) and GNUTLS
   (http://gnutls.hellug.gr/)

 LDAP

 * Look over the implementation. The looping will have to "go away" from the
   lib/ldap.c source file and get moved to the main network code so that the
   multi interface and friends will work for LDAP as well.

 CLIENT

 * Add an option that prevents cURL from overwiting existing local files. When
   used, and there already is an existing file with the target file name
   (either -O or -o), a number should be appended (and increased if already
   existing). So that index.html becomes first index.html.1 and then
   index.html.2 etc. Jeff Pohlmeyer suggested.

 * "curl ftp://site.com/*.txt"

 * The client could be told to use maximum N simultaneous transfers and then
   just make sure that happens. It should of course not make more than one
   connection to the same remote host. This would require the client to use
   the multi interface.

 * Extending the capabilities of the multipart formposting. How about leaving
   the ';type=foo' syntax as it is and adding an extra tag (headers) which
   works like this: curl -F "coolfiles=@fil1.txt;headers=@fil1.hdr" where
   fil1.hdr contains extra headers like

     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=KOI8-R"
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
     X-User-Comment: Please don't use browser specific HTML code

   which should overwrite the program reasonable defaults (plain/text,
   8bit...) (Idea brough to us by kromJx)

 * ability to specify the classic computing suffixes on the range
   specifications. For example, to download the first 500 Kilobytes of a file,
   be able to specify the following for the -r option: "-r 0-500K" or for the
   first 2 Megabytes of a file: "-r 0-2M". (Mark Smith suggested)

 * --data-encode that URL encodes the data before posting
   http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2003-11/0091.html (Kevin Roth suggested)

 BUILD

 * Consider extending 'roffit' to produce decent ASCII output, and use that
   instead of (g)nroff when building src/hugehelp.c
  
 TEST SUITE

 * Make the test servers able to serve multiple running test suites. Like if
   two users run 'make test' at once.

 * Make runtests.pl capable of changing port numbers for the servers. This was
   the intention from the start, but in practise it is now hard.

 * If perl wasn't found by the configure script, don't attempt to run the
   tests but explain something nice why it doesn't.

 * Extend the test suite to include more protocols. The telnet could just do
   ftp or http operations (for which we have test servers).

 * Make the test suite work on more platforms. OpenBSD and Mac OS. Remove
   fork()s and it should become even more portable.

 NEXT MAJOR RELEASE

 * curl_easy_cleanup() returns void, but curl_multi_cleanup() returns a
   CURLMcode. These should be changed to be the same.

 * curl_formparse() should be removed

 * remove obsolete defines from curl/curl.h

 * remove the following functions from the public API:
   curl_getenv
   curl_mprintf (and variations)
   curl_strequal
   curl_strnequal

   They will instead become curlx_ - alternatives. That makes the curl app
   still capable of building with them from source.
