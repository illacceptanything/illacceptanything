<p class="level0"><a name="NAME"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">NAME</h2>
<p class="level0">curl - transfer a URL <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">curl [options]</span> <a class="emphasis" href="#URL">[URL...]</a> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">curl</span> is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE). The command is designed to work without user interaction. 
<p class="level0">curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, ftp upload, HTTP post, SSL (https:) connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more. As you will see below, the amount of features will make your head spin! 
<p class="level0">curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See <span Class="manpage">libcurl (3)</span> for details. <a name="URL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">URL</h2>
<p class="level0">The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC 2396. 
<p class="level0">You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets within braces as in: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;<a href="http://site">http://site</a>.{one,two,three}.com 
<p class="level0">or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt &nbsp;ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with leading zeros) &nbsp;ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt 
<p class="level0">No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.any.org/archive">http://www.any.org/archive</a>[1996-1999]/volume[1-4]part{a,b,c,index}.html 
<p class="level0">You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order. 
<p class="level0">Curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so that getting many files from the same server will not do multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between separate curl invokes. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="-a--append"></a><span class="nroffip">-a/--append</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) When used in an FTP upload, this will tell curl to append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second one will disable append mode again. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-A--user-agent"></a><span class="nroffip">-A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. Some badly done CGIs fail if its not set to "Mozilla/4.0".  To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks.  This can also be set with the <a class="emphasis" href="#-H--header">-H/--header</a> option of course. 
<p class="level1">If this option is set more than once, the last one will be the one that's used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--anyauth"></a><span class="nroffip">--anyauth</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims it supports. This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a specific authentication method, which you can do with <a class="emphasis" href="#--basic">--basic</a>, <a class="emphasis" href="#--digest">--digest</a>, <a class="emphasis" href="#--ntlm">--ntlm</a>, and <a class="emphasis" href="#--negotiate">--negotiate</a>. (Added in 7.10.6) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-b--cookie"></a><span class="nroffip">-b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server as a cookie. It is supposedly the data previously received from the server in a "Set-Cookie:" line. The data should be in the format "NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2". 
<p class="level1">If no '=' letter is used in the line, it is treated as a filename to use to read previously stored cookie lines from, which should be used in this session if they match. Using this method also activates the "cookie parser" which will make curl record incoming cookies too, which may be handy if you're using this in combination with the <a class="emphasis" href="#-L--location">-L/--location</a> option. The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">NOTE</span> that the file specified with <a class="emphasis" href="#-b--cookie">-b/--cookie</a> is only used as input. No cookies will be stored in the file. To store cookies, use the <a class="emphasis" href="#-c--cookie-jar">-c/--cookie-jar</a> option or you could even save the HTTP headers to a file using <a class="emphasis" href="#-D--dump-header">-D/--dump-header</a>! 
<p class="level1">If this option is set more than once, the last one will be the one that's used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-B--use-ascii"></a><span class="nroffip">-B/--use-ascii</span> 
<p class="level1">Use ASCII transfer when getting an FTP file or LDAP info. For FTP, this can also be enforced by using an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second one will disable ASCII usage. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--basic"></a><span class="nroffip">--basic</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication. This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use it to override a previously set option that sets a different authentication method (such as <a class="emphasis" href="#--ntlm">--ntlm</a>, <a class="emphasis" href="#--digest">--digest</a> and <a class="emphasis" href="#--negotiate">--negotiate</a>). (Added in 7.10.6) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--ciphers"></a><span class="nroffip">--ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of ciphers must be using valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this URL: <span Class="emphasis"><a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</a></span> 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will override the others. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--compressed"></a><span class="nroffip">--compressed</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms libcurl supports, and return the uncompressed document.  If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported encoding, Curl will report an error. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle it on/off. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--connect-timeout"></a><span class="nroffip">--connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take. This only limits the connection phase, once curl has connected this option is of no more use. See also the <span Class="emphasis">--max-time</span> option. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-c--cookie-jar"></a><span class="nroffip">-c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies previously read from a specified file as well as all cookies received from remote server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be written. The file will be written using the Netscape cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash, "-", the cookies will be written to stdout. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">NOTE</span> If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v will get a warning displayed, but that is the only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last specfied file name will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-C--continue-at"></a><span class="nroffip">-C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped counted from the beginning of the source file before it is transfered to the destination.  If used with uploads, the ftp server command SIZE will not be used by curl. 
<p class="level1">Use "-C -" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files to figure that out. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--create-dirs"></a><span class="nroffip">--create-dirs</span> 
<p class="level1">When used in conjunction with the -o option, curl will create the necessary  local directory hierarchy as needed. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--crlf"></a><span class="nroffip">--crlf</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for MVS (OS/390). 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable crlf converting. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-d--data"></a><span class="nroffip">-d/--data &lt;data&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in a way that can emulate as if a user has filled in a HTML form and pressed the submit button. Note that the data is sent exactly as specified with no extra processing (with all newlines cut off).  The data is expected to be &zerosp;"url-encoded". This will cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to <a class="emphasis" href="#-F--form">-F/--form</a>. If this option is used more than once on the same command line, the data pieces specified will be merged together with a separating &-letter. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like &zerosp;'name=daniel&skill=lousy'. 
<p class="level1">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data from stdin.  The contents of the file must already be url-encoded. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with <span Class="emphasis">--data</span> @foobar". 
<p class="level1">To post data purely binary, you should instead use the <a class="emphasis" href="#--data-binary">--data-binary</a> option. 
<p class="level1"><a class="emphasis" href="#-d--data">-d/--data</a> is the same as <a class="emphasis" href="#--data-ascii">--data-ascii</a>. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--data-ascii"></a><span class="nroffip">--data-ascii &lt;data&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) This is an alias for the <a class="emphasis" href="#-d--data">-d/--data</a> option. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--data-binary"></a><span class="nroffip">--data-binary &lt;data&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) This posts data in a similar manner as <a class="emphasis" href="#--data-ascii">--data-ascii</a> does, although when using this option the entire context of the posted data is kept as-is. If you want to post a binary file without the strip-newlines feature of the <a class="emphasis" href="#--data-ascii">--data-ascii</a> option, this is for you. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the ones following the first will append data. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--digest"></a><span class="nroffip">--digest</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is a authentication that prevents the password from being sent over the wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal <a class="emphasis" href="#-u--user">-u/--user</a> option to set user name and password. See also <a class="emphasis" href="#--ntlm">--ntlm</a>, <a class="emphasis" href="#--negotiate">--negotiate</a> and <a class="emphasis" href="#--anyauth">--anyauth</a> for related options. (Added in curl 7.10.6) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--disable-eprt"></a><span class="nroffip">--disable-eprt</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP protocol, may not work on all servers but enable more functionality in a better way than the traditional PORT command. (Aded in 7.10.5) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--disable-epsv"></a><span class="nroffip">--disable-epsv</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when doing passive FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not try using EPSV. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-D--dump-header"></a><span class="nroffip">-D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Write the protocol headers to the specified file. 
<p class="level1">This option is handy to use when you want to store the headers that a HTTP site sends to you. Cookies from the headers could then be read in a second curl invoke by using the <a class="emphasis" href="#-b--cookie">-b/--cookie</a> option! The <a class="emphasis" href="#-c--cookie-jar">-c/--cookie-jar</a> option is however a better way to store cookies. 
<p class="level1">When used on FTP, the ftp server response lines are considered being "headers" and thus are saved there. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-e--referer"></a><span class="nroffip">-e/--referer &lt;URL&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server. This can also be set with the <a class="emphasis" href="#-H--header">-H/--header</a> flag of course.  When used with <a class="emphasis" href="#-L--location">-L/--location</a> you can append ";auto" to the referer URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header. The ";auto" string can be used alone, even if you don't set an initial referer. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--environment"></a><span class="nroffip">--environment</span> 
<p class="level1">(RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range of environment variables, using the names the -w option supports, to easier allow extraction of useful information after having run curl. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--egd-file"></a><span class="nroffip">--egd-file &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTPS) Specify the path name to the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. The socket is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the <a class="emphasis" href="#--random-file">--random-file</a> option. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-E--cert"></a><span class="nroffip">-E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file when getting a file with HTTPS. The certificate must be in PEM format. If the optional password isn't specified, it will be queried for on the terminal. Note that this certificate is the private key and the private certificate concatenated! 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--cert-type"></a><span class="nroffip">--cert-type &lt;type&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) Tells curl what certificate type the provided certificate is in. PEM, DER and ENG are recognized types. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--cacert"></a><span class="nroffip">--cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer. The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format. 
<p class="level1">curl recognizes the environment variable named 'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if that is set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that variable. 
<p class="level1">The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA certs file named &acute;curl-ca-bundle.crt&acute;, either in the same directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder along your PATH. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--capath"></a><span class="nroffip">--capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the peer. The certificates must be in PEM format, and the directory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with openssl. Using <a class="emphasis" href="#--capath">--capath</a> can allow curl to make https connections much more efficiently than using <a class="emphasis" href="#--cacert">--cacert</a> if the <a class="emphasis" href="#--cacert">--cacert</a> file contains many CA certificates. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-f--fail"></a><span class="nroffip">-f/--fail</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly done like this to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In normal cases when a HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns a HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more). This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and fail silently instead. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--ftp-create-dirs"></a><span class="nroffip">--ftp-create-dirs</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) When an FTP URL/operation uses a path that doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to create missing directories. (Added in 7.10.7) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--ftp-pasv"></a><span class="nroffip">--ftp-pasv</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Use PASV when transfering. PASV is the internal default behavior, but using this option can be used to override a previos --ftp-port option. (Added in 7.11.0) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--ftp-ssl"></a><span class="nroffip">--ftp-ssl</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Make the FTP connection switch to use SSL/TLS. (Added in 7.11.0) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable silent failure. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-F--form"></a><span class="nroffip">-F/--form &lt;name=content&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the content-type multipart/form-data according to RFC1867. This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the 'content' part to be be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the letter &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file. 
<p class="level1">Example, to send your password file to the server, where &zerosp;'password' is the name of the form-field to which /etc/passwd will be the input: 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com 
<p class="level1">To read the file's content from stdin insted of a file, use - where the file name should've been. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. 
<p class="level1">You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use for the file upload part, by using 'type=', in a manner similar to: 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">curl</span> -F "web=@index.html;type=text/html" url.com 
<p class="level1">See further examples and details in the MANUAL. 
<p class="level1">This option can be used multiple times. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-g--globoff"></a><span class="nroffip">-g/--globoff</span> 
<p class="level1">This option switches off the "URL globbing parser". When you set this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to the URI standard. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-G--get"></a><span class="nroffip">-G/--get</span> 
<p class="level1">When used, this option will make all data specified with <a class="emphasis" href="#-d--data">-d/--data</a> or <a class="emphasis" href="#--data-binary">--data-binary</a> to be used in a HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?'  separator. 
<p class="level1">If used in combination with -I, the POST data will instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request. 
<p class="level1">If used multiple times, nothing special happens. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-h--help"></a><span class="nroffip">-h/--help</span> 
<p class="level1">Usage help. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-H--header"></a><span class="nroffip">-H/--header &lt;header&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Replacing an internal header with one without content on the right side of the colon will prevent that header from appearing. 
<p class="level1">See also the <a class="emphasis" href="#-A--user-agent">-A/--user-agent</a> and <a class="emphasis" href="#-e--referer">-e/--referer</a> options. 
<p class="level1">This option can be used multiple times to add/replace/remove multiple headers. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-i--include"></a><span class="nroffip">-i/--include</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Include the HTTP-header in the output. The HTTP-header includes things like server-name, date of the document, HTTP-version and more... 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header include. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--interface"></a><span class="nroffip">--interface &lt;name&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or host name. An example could look like: 
<p class="level1">&nbsp;curl --interface eth0:1 <a href="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</a>/ 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-I--head"></a><span class="nroffip">-I/--head</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP/FTP/FILE) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers feature the command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When used on a FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last modification time only. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable header only. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-j--junk-session-cookies"></a><span class="nroffip">-j/--junk-session-cookies</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option will make it discard all "session cookies". This will basicly have the same effect as if a new session is started. Typical browsers always discard session cookies when they're closed down. (Added in 7.9.7) 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, each occurrence will toggle this on/off. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-k--insecure"></a><span class="nroffip">-k/--insecure</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers. Starting with curl 7.10, all SSL connections will be attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" to fail unless <a class="emphasis" href="#-k--insecure">-k/--insecure</a> is used. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second time will again disable it. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--key"></a><span class="nroffip">--key &lt;key&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your private key in this separate file. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--key-type"></a><span class="nroffip">--key-type &lt;type&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) Private key file type. Specify which type your <a class="emphasis" href="#--key">--key</a> provided private key is. DER, PEM and ENG are supported. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--krb4"></a><span class="nroffip">--krb4 &lt;level&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Enable kerberos4 authentication and use. The level must be entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential' or 'private'. Should you use a level that is not one of these, 'private' will instead be used. 
<p class="level1">This option requiures that the library was built with kerberos4 support. This is not very common. Use <a class="emphasis" href="#-V--version">-V/--version</a> to see if your curl supports it. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-K--config"></a><span class="nroffip">-K/--config &lt;config file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify which config file to read curl arguments from. The config file is a text file in which command line arguments can be written which then will be used as if they were written on the actual command line. Options and their parameters must be specified on the same config file line. If the parameter is to contain white spaces, the parameter must be inclosed within quotes.  If the first column of a config line is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a comment. 
<p class="level1">Specify the filename as '-' to make curl read the file from stdin. 
<p class="level1">Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you need to specify it using the <a class="emphasis" href="#--url">--url</a> option, and not by simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this: 
<p class="level1">url = "<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs">http://curl.haxx.se/docs</a>/" 
<p class="level1">This option can be used multiple times. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--limit-rate"></a><span class="nroffip">--limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not use your entire bandwidth. 
<p class="level1">The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is appended. Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it megabytes while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G. 
<p class="level1">If you are also using the <a class="emphasis" href="#-Y--speed-limit">-Y/--speed-limit</a> option, that option will take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working. 
<p class="level1">This option was introduced in curl 7.10. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-l--list-only"></a><span class="nroffip">-l/--list-only</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view. Especially useful if you want to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format. 
<p class="level1">This option causes an FTP NLST command to be sent.  Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not include subdirectories and symbolic links. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable list only. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-L--location"></a><span class="nroffip">-L/--location</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP/HTTPS) If the server reports that the requested page has a different location (indicated with the header line Location:) this flag will let curl attempt to reattempt the get on the new place. If used together with <a class="emphasis" href="#-i--include">-i/--include</a> or <a class="emphasis" href="#-I--head">-I/--head</a>, headers from all requested pages will be shown. If authentication is used, curl will only send its credentials to the initial host, so if a redirect takes curl to a different host, it won't intercept the user+password. See also <a class="emphasis" href="#--location-trusted">--location-trusted</a> on how to change this. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable location following. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--location-trusted"></a><span class="nroffip">--location-trusted</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP/HTTPS) Like <a class="emphasis" href="#-L--location">-L/--location</a>, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you do a site to which you'll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication). 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable location following. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--max-filesize"></a><span class="nroffip">--max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63. 
<p class="level1">NOTE: The file size is not always known prior to download, and for such files this option has no effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than this given limit. This concerns both FTP and HTTP transfers. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-m--max-time"></a><span class="nroffip">-m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation to take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.  This doesn't work fully in win32 systems.  See also the <a class="emphasis" href="#--connect-timeout">--connect-timeout</a> option. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-M--manual"></a><span class="nroffip">-M/--manual</span> 
<p class="level1">Manual. Display the huge help text. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-n--netrc"></a><span class="nroffip">-n/--netrc</span> 
<p class="level1">Makes curl scan the <span Class="emphasis">.netrc</span> file in the user's home directory for login name and password. This is typically used for ftp on unix. If used with http, curl will enable user authentication. See <span Class="manpage">netrc(4)</span> or <span Class="manpage">ftp(1)</span> for details on the file format. Curl will not complain if that file hasn't the right permissions (it should not be world nor group readable). The environment variable "HOME" is used to find the home directory. 
<p class="level1">A quick and very simple example of how to setup a <span Class="emphasis">.netrc</span> to allow curl to ftp to the machine host.domain.com with user name &zerosp;'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to: 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">machine host.domain.com login myself password secret</span> 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable netrc usage. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--netrc-optional"></a><span class="nroffip">--netrc-optional</span> 
<p class="level1">Very similar to <span Class="emphasis">--netrc</span>, but this option makes the .netrc usage <span Class="bold">optional</span> and not mandatory as the <span Class="emphasis">--netrc</span> does. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--negotiate"></a><span class="nroffip">--negotiate</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Enables GSS-Negotiate authentication. The GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft and is used in their web aplications. It is primarily meant as a support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used along with another authentication methods. For more information see IETF draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt. (Added in 7.10.6) 
<p class="level1">This option requiures that the library was built with GSSAPI support. This is not very common. Use <a class="emphasis" href="#-V--version">-V/--version</a> to see if your version supports GSS-Negotiate. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-N--no-buffer"></a><span class="nroffip">-N/--no-buffer</span> 
<p class="level1">Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work situations, curl will use a standard buffered output stream that will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data arrives. Using this option will disable that buffering. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again switch on buffering. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--ntlm"></a><span class="nroffip">--ntlm</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol, reversed engineered by clever people and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior should not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentication method instead. Such as Digest. (Added in 7.10.6) 
<p class="level1">If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication, then use <a class="emphasis" href="#--proxy-ntlm">--proxy-ntlm</a>. 
<p class="level1">This option requiures that the library was built with SSL support. Use <a class="emphasis" href="#-V--version">-V/--version</a> to see if your curl supports NTLM. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the following occurrences make no difference. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-o--output"></a><span class="nroffip">-o/--output &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you can use '#' followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That variable will be replaced with the current string for the URL being fetched. Like in: 
<p class="level1">&nbsp; curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt" 
<p class="level1">or use several variables like: 
<p class="level1">&nbsp; curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2" 
<p class="level1">You may use this option as many times as you have number of URLs. 
<p class="level1">See also the <a class="emphasis" href="#--create-dirs">--create-dirs</a> option to create the local directories dynamically. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-O--remote-name"></a><span class="nroffip">-O/--remote-name</span> 
<p class="level1">Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.) 
<p class="level1">You may use this option as many times as you have number of URLs. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--pass"></a><span class="nroffip">--pass &lt;phrase&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(SSL) Pass phrase for the private key 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--proxy-ntlm"></a><span class="nroffip">--proxy-ntlm</span> 
<p class="level1">Tells curl to use NTLM authentication when communicating with the given proxy. Use <a class="emphasis" href="#--ntlm">--ntlm</a> for enabling NTLM with a remote host. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy NTLM. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-p--proxytunnel"></a><span class="nroffip">-p/--proxytunnel</span> 
<p class="level1">When an HTTP proxy is used (<a class="emphasis" href="#-x--proxy">-x/--proxy</a>), this option will cause non-HTTP protocols to attempt to tunnel through the proxy instead of merely using it to do HTTP-like operations. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable proxy tunnel. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-P--ftp-port"></a><span class="nroffip">-P/--ftp-port &lt;address&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Reverses the initiator/listener roles when connecting with ftp. This switch makes Curl use the PORT command instead of PASV. In practice, PORT tells the server to connect to the client's specified address and port, while PASV asks the server for an ip address and port to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be one of: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="interface"></a><span class="nroffip">interface</span> 
<p class="level2">i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you want to use  (Unix only) 
<p class="level1"><a name="IP"></a><span class="nroffip">IP address</span> 
<p class="level2">i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP number 
<p class="level1"><a name="host"></a><span class="nroffip">host name</span> 
<p class="level2">i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine 
<p class="level1"><a name="-"></a><span class="nroffip">-</span> 
<p class="level2">(any single-letter string) to make it pick the machine's default 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. Disable the use of PORT with <a class="emphasis" href="#--ftp-pasv">--ftp-pasv</a>. Disable the attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using <a class="emphasis" href="#--disable-eprt">--disable-eprt</a>. EPRT is really PORT++. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-q"></a><span class="nroffip">-q</span> 
<p class="level1">If used as the first parameter on the command line, the <span Class="emphasis">$HOME/.curlrc</span> file will not be read and used as a config file. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-Q--quote"></a><span class="nroffip">-Q/--quote &lt;comand&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(FTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP server, by using the QUOTE command of the server. Not all servers support this command, and the set of QUOTE commands are server specific! Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer is taking place. To make commands take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'. You may specify any amount of commands to be run before and after the transfer. If the server returns failure for one of the commands, the entire operation will be aborted. 
<p class="level1">This option can be used multiple times. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--random-file"></a><span class="nroffip">--random-file &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTPS) Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered as random data. The data is used to seed the random engine for SSL connections. See also the <a class="emphasis" href="#--egd-file">--egd-file</a> option. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-r--range"></a><span class="nroffip">-r/--range &lt;range&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">(HTTP/FTP) Retrieve a byte range (i.e a partial document) from a HTTP/1.1 or FTP server. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">0-499</span> specifies the first 500 bytes 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">500-999</span> specifies the second 500 bytes 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">-500</span> specifies the last 500 bytes 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">9500</span> specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">0-0,-1</span> specifies the first and last byte only(*)(H) 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">500-700,600-799</span> specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H) 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">100-199,500-599</span> specifies two separate 100 bytes ranges(*)(H) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">(*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a multipart response! 
<p class="level1">You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get a range, you'll instead get the whole document. 
<p class="level1">FTP range downloads only support the simple syntax 'start-stop' (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). It depends on the non-RFC command SIZE. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-R--remote-time"></a><span class="nroffip">-R/--remote-time</span> 
<p class="level1">When used, this will make libcurl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the remote file, and if that is available make the local file get that same timestamp. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second time disables this again. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-s--silent"></a><span class="nroffip">-s/--silent</span> 
<p class="level1">Silent mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.  Makes Curl mute. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable mute. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-S--show-error"></a><span class="nroffip">-S/--show-error</span> 
<p class="level1">When used with -s it makes curl show error message if it fails. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable show error. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--socks"></a><span class="nroffip">--socks &lt;host[:port]&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080. (Option added in 7.11.1) 
<p class="level1">This option overrides any previous use of <a class="emphasis" href="#-x--proxy">-x/--proxy</a>, as they are mutually exclusive. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--stderr"></a><span class="nroffip">--stderr &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout. This option has no point when you're using a shell with decent redirecting capabilities. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-t--telnet-option"></a><span class="nroffip">-t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are: 
<p class="level1">TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type. 
<p class="level1">XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location. 
<p class="level1">NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-T--upload-file"></a><span class="nroffip">-T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no file part in the specified URL, Curl will append the local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to fail. If this is used on a http(s) server, the PUT command will be used. 
<p class="level1">Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a given file. 
<p class="level1">Before 7.10.8, when this option was used several times, the last one was used. 
<p class="level1">In curl 7.10.8 and later, you can specify one -T for each URL on the command line. Each -T + URL pair specifies what to upload and to where. curl also supports "globbing" of the -T argument, meaning that you can upload multiple files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style supported in the URL, like this: 
<p class="level1">curl -T "{file1,file2}" <a href="http://www.uploadtothissite.com">http://www.uploadtothissite.com</a> 
<p class="level1">or even 
<p class="level1">curl -T "img[1-1000].png" ftp://ftp.picturemania.com/upload/ 
<p class="level0"><a name="--trace"></a><span class="nroffip">--trace &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

<p class="level0"><a name="--trace-ascii"></a><span class="nroffip">--trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, to the given output file. Use "-" as filename to have the output sent to stdout. 
<p class="level1">This is very similar to <a class="emphasis" href="#--trace">--trace</a>, but leaves out the hex part and only shows the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output that might be easier to read for untrained humans. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. (Added in 7.9.7) 
<p class="level0"><a name="-u--user"></a><span class="nroffip">-u/--user &lt;user:password&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify user and password to use for server authentication. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-U--proxy-user"></a><span class="nroffip">-U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify user and password to use for proxy authentication. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="--url"></a><span class="nroffip">--url &lt;URL&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you want to specify URL(s) in a config file. 
<p class="level1">This option may be used any number of times. To control where this URL is written, use the <a class="emphasis" href="#-o--output">-o/--output</a> or the <a class="emphasis" href="#-O--remote-name">-O/--remote-name</a> options. 
<p class="level0"><a name="-v--verbose"></a><span class="nroffip">-v/--verbose</span> 
<p class="level1">Makes the fetching more verbose/talkative. Mostly usable for debugging. Lines starting with '&gt;' means data sent by curl, '&lt;' means data received by curl that is hidden in normal cases and lines starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl. 
<p class="level1">Note that if you want to see HTTP headers in the output, <a class="emphasis" href="#-i--include">-i/--include</a> might be option you're looking for. 
<p class="level1">If you think this option still doesn't give you enough details, consider using <a class="emphasis" href="#--trace">--trace</a> or <a class="emphasis" href="#--trace-ascii">--trace-ascii</a> instead. 
<p class="level1">If this option is used twice, the second will again disable verbose.
