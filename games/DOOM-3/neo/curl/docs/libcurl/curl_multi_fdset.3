                           fd_set *write_fd_set,

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function extracts file descriptor information from a given multi_handle.
libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these to select() or
poll() on. The curl_multi_perform() function should be called as soon as one
of them are ready to be read from or written to.

NOTE that once this call is made, you must not remove the sets you point to,
as libcurl will need to be able to read them. It needs them after select()
calls, to know if certain sockets are readable or writable.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code. See
\fIlibcurl-errors.3\fP
