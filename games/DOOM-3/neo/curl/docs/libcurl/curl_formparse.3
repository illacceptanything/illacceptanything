curl_formparse - add a section to a multipart/formdata HTTP POST:
deprecated (use curl_formadd instead)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "struct HttpPost ** " lastitem ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This has been removed deliberately. The \fBcurl_formadd\fP has been introduced
to replace this function. Do not use this. Convert to the new function
now. curl_formparse() will be removed from a future version of libcurl.
