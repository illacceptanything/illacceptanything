#  What is This Script?
###########################

# testcurl.sh is the master script to use for automatic testing of CVS-curl.
# This is written for the purpose of being run from a crontab job or similar
# at a regular interval. The output will be suitable to be mailed automaticly
# to "curl-autocompile@haxx.se" to be dealt with automatically.  The most
# current build status (with a resonable backlog) will be published on the
# curl site, at http://curl.haxx.se/auto/

# USAGE:
# testcurl.sh [curl-daily-name] > output

# Updated: 
# v1.1 6-Nov-03 - to take an optional parameter, the name of a daily-build
#                 directory.  If present, build from that directory, otherwise
#                 perform a normal CVS build.
