 The file format of the test suite is a very simple and extendable format. All
data for a single test case resides in a single ASCII file. Labels mark the
beginning and the end of all sections. Each label must be written in its own
line and is resembling XML/HTML.

 Each file is split up in three main sections: reply, client and verify. The
reply section is used for the server to know what to send as a reply for the
requests curl sends, the client section defines how the client should behave
while the verify section defines how to verify that the data stored after a
command has been run ended up correctly.

 Each main section has a number of available subsections that can be
specified, that will be checked/used if specified. This document includes all
the subsections currently supported.

<reply>
<data [nocheck=1]>
data to sent to the client on its request and later verified that it arrived
safely. Set the nocheck=1 to prevent the test script to verify the arrival
of this data.

If the data contains 'swsclose' *anywhere* within the start and end tag, and
this is a HTTP test, then the connection will be closed by the server after
this response is sent. If not, the connection will be kept persistant.
</data>
<dataNUM>
Send back this contents instead of the <data> one. The num is set by:
A) The test number in the request line is >10000 and this is the remainder
of [test case number]%10000.
B) The request was HTTP and included digest details, which adds 1000 to NUM
C) If a HTTP request is NTLM type-1, it adds 1001 to num
D) If a HTTP request is NTLM type-3, it adds 1002 to num
</dateNUM>
<datacheck [nonewline=yes]>
if the data is sent but this is what should be checked afterwards. If
'nonewline' is set, we will cut off the trailing newline of this given data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client
</datacheck>
<size>
number to return on a ftp SIZE command (set to -1 to make this command fail)
</size>
<mdtm>
what to send back if the client sends a (FTP) MDTM command, set to -1 to
have it return that the file doesn't exist
</mdtm>
<cmd>
special purpose server-command to control its behavior *before* the
reply is sent
</cmd>
<postcmd>
special purpose server-command to control its behavior *after* the
reply is sent
</postcmd>
</reply>

<client>

<server>
protocols as in 'http' 'ftp' etc. Give only one per line. Used for test cases
500+ (at this point) to specify which servers the test case requires. In the
future all test cases should use this. Makes us independent of the test
case number.
</server>

<features>
A list of features that must be present in the client/library for this test
to be able to run. Features testable here are:
SSL
netrc_debug
large_file
</features>

<killserver>
Using the same syntax as in <server> but when mentioned here these servers
are explicitly KILLED when this test case is completed. Only use this if there
is no other alternatives. Using this of course requires subsequent tests to
restart servers.
</killserver>

<tool>
Name of tool to use instead of "curl". This tool must be built and exist
in the libtest/ directory.
</tool>

<name>
test case description
</name>

<setenv>
variable1=contents1
variable2=contents2

Set the given environment variables to the specified value before the actual
command is run, they are clear again after the command has been run.
</setenv>

<command [option=no-output]>
command line to run, there's a bunch of %variables that get replaced
accordingly.

Note that the URL that gets passed to the server actually controls what data
that is returned. The last slash in the URL must be followed by a number. That
number (N) will be used by the test-server to load test case N and return the
data that is defined within the <reply><data></data></reply> section.

If a CONNECT is used to the server (to emulate HTTPS etc over proxy), the port
number given in the CONNECT request will be used to identify which test that
is being run, if the proxy host name is said to start with 'test'.

Set 'option=no-output' to prevent the test script to slap on the --output
argument that directs the output to a file. The --output is also not added if
the client/stdout section is used.

Available substitute variables include:
%HOSTIP    - IP address of the host running this test
%HOSTPORT  - Port number of the HTTP server
%HTTPSPORT - Port number of the HTTPS server
%FTPPORT   - Port number of the FTP server
%FTPSPORT  - Port number of the FTPS server
%SRCDIR    - Full path to the source dir
%PWD       - Current directory
</command>

<file name="log/filename">
this creates the named file with this content before the test case is run
which is useful if the test case needs a file to act on.
</file>

<stdin>
Pass this given data on stdin to the tool.
</stdin>

</client>

<verify>
<errorcode>
numerical error code curl is supposed to return
</errorcode>
<strip>
One regex per line that is removed from the protocol dumps before the
comparison is made. This is very useful to remove dependencies on dynamicly
changing protocol data such as port numbers or user-agent strings.
</strip>
<protocol [nonewline=yes]>
the protocol dump curl should transmit, if 'nonewline' is set, we will cut
off the trailing newline of this given data before comparing with the one
actually sent by the client
</protocol>
<stdout>
This verfies that this data was passed to stdout.
</stdout>
<file name="log/filename">
the file's contents must be identical to this
</file>
<upload>
the contents of the upload data curl should have sent
</upload>
</verify>
