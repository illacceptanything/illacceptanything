DOOM III Linux SDK
==================

The DOOM build system is based on scons ( a make replacement )
http://www.scons.org/
packages are available for most recent distributions

To build, invoke scons from the src/ directory
use 'scons -h' for build configuration options
scons 0.96 or newer is required for build

Release 1.3.1 is compiled with gcc 4.0. Note that you can specify the compiler by setting CC and CXX on the command line. If you use a different gcc release line than 4.x, you may run into ABI issues.
