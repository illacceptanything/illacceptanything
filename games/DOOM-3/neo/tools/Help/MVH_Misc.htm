		<P><STRONG>Spawn Class Drop Down</STRONG></P>
		<P>Collates the entity types by spawn class for easier navigation of ModView. 
			Whenever a new spawn class is selected, the entity type drop down box is 
			populated with all the entity types that have the just selected spawn class. A 
			loaded mesh will have the spawn class of "&lt;file&gt;".</P>
		<P><STRONG>Entity Type Drop Down</STRONG></P>
		<P>A list of entity types with the above selected spawn class. Whenever an entity 
			type is selected, the associated mesh is loaded and displayed. The def file is 
			parsed and the relevant animations are added to the "Animations Available" list 
			view box. A loaded mesh will have the entity type of it's filename within 
			chevrons. eg. "&lt;models/md5/meshes/player.md5mesh&gt;".</P>
		<P><STRONG>Animations Available List</STRONG></P>
		<P>This lists the animations found in the def file. You can select one or many and 
			move them to the current animation sequence with the "&gt;&gt;" button to the 
			right of this list. If an animation will not go to the sequence window, then it 
			was not found or there was some other problem with it. Loaded animations will 
			go here as their filename, and also to the "Animations Loaded" list. These 
			loaded animations will be remembered as associated to this spawn class/entity 
			type combination as long as ModView is running.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Animations Loaded List</STRONG></P>
		<P>This is the list of animations that have been successfully loaded and can be 
			played or stepped through using the toolbar controls. Unchecking a particular 
			animation in the list will temporarily disable the playback of this animation 
			in the sequence. Selecting one or more animations and pressing the delete key 
			will remove them from the list permenantly; that is, until you re add them from 
			the "Animations Available" list.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Animation Frame Slider &amp; Text</STRONG></P>
		<P>The slider displays the current frame of animation in the current sequence of 
			animations and takes into account deleted and disabled animations. Hitting 
			either end of the slider acts the same as pressing the stop toolbar control but 
			steps one frame at a time in the desired direction. Hitting the slider bar 
			either side of the button advances the animation ten frames in the desired 
			direction. The slider button can be dragged to&nbsp;a specific frame. The text 
			above this slider shows the exact frame number out of how many frames, and the 
			current playing animation in brackets.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Timescale Slider</STRONG></P>
		<P>The slider sets the global speed of the animation playback. It defaults to 1.0 
			and can go from the minimum of 0.02 to the maximum of 2.0 (double the playback 
			speed).</P>
		<P><STRONG>Light Intensity Sliders</STRONG></P>
		<P>There are six lights surrounding the model and these sliders adjust their 
			brightness. The range is from 0 (completely black) to 255 (bright white). The 
			starting default is 128 (medium grey). There are no current options for 
			multicoloured lights.</P>
