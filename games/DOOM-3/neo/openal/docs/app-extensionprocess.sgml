     There are two ways to suggest an Extension to AL or ALC.
     The simplest way is to write an ASCII text that matches
     the following template:

     <literallayout>

         RFC:         rfc-iiyymmdd-nn
         Name:        (indicating the purpose/feature)
         Maintainer:  (name and spam-secured e-mail)
         Date:        (last revision)
         Revision:    (last revision)

         new enums
         new functions

         description of operation

     </literallayout>

    Such an RFC can be submitted on the &AL; discussion
    list (please use RFC in the Subject line), or send to the
    maintainer of the &AL; specification. If you are shipping
    an actual implementation as a patch or as part of the
    &AL; CVS a formal writeup is recommend. In this case,
    the Extension has to be described as part of the
    specification, which is maintained in DocBook SGML
    (available for UNIX, Linux and Win32). The SGML source of
    the specification is available by CVS, and the Appendix
    on Extensions can be used as a template. Contact the
    maintainer for details.
