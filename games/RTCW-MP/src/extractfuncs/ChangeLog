Modified extractfuncs to works on linux
Would still need to integrate it correctly with the build system
Changed the command line syntax of the linux ver:
screwup [-o <basename>] <file1> [<file2> ..]

if none specified, <basename> is "g_funcs"

on linux at least, those header files need to be tweaked by hand
because unresolved externs are not ignored by gcc (otherwise harmless on win32)
